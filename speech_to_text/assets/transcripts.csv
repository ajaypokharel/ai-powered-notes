0c8ca088-a2dd-41d3-ab39-e2e9023d2062,"As we begin our journey into the world of economics, I thought I would begin with a quote from one of the most famous economists of all times, the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith. And he really is kind of the first real economist in the way that we view it now. And this is from his The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, coincidentally, the same year as the American Declaration of Independence. And it's one of the most famous excerpts. He generally, indeed, he being an economic actor, neither intends to promote the public interest nor knows how much he is promoting it. By directing that industry, so the industry in control of that individual actor, in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain. He intends only his own gain. And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. And this term, invisible hand, is famous. Led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. He's saying, look, when individual actors just act in their own self-interest, that often an aggregate leads to things that each of those individual actors did not intend. And then he says, nor is it always the worst for society that it was no part of it. So it's not always necessarily a bad thing. By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. So this is a pretty strong statement. It's really at the core of capitalism. And that's why I point out that it was published the same year as the American Declaration of Independence because, obviously, America, the founding fathers, they wrote the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution. It really talks about what it means to be a democratic country. What are the rights of its citizens? But the United States, in its overall, the overall experience of an American is at least as influenced by the work of Adam Smith, by these kind of foundational ideas of capitalism. And they just both happened to happen around the same time. But this idea, it's not always that intuitive. Individual actors, by essentially pursuing their own self-interested ends, might be doing more for society than if any of them actually try to promote the overall well-being of society. And I don't think Adam Smith would say that it's always good for someone to act self-interested or that it's never good for people to actually think about the implications of what they're doing in an aggregate sense. But he's saying that frequently, frequently, this self-interested action could lead to the greater good, could lead to more innovation, could lead to better investment, could lead to more productivity, could lead to more wealth, more, a larger pie for everyone. And now economics is frequently, and when he makes a statement, he's actually making a mix of a microeconomic and a macroeconomic statement. Micro is that people, individual actors, are acting in their own self-interest. And the macro is that it might be good for the economy or for the nation as a whole. And so now, modern economists tend to divide themselves into these two schools or into these two subjects. Microeconomics, which is the study of individual actors. Microeconomics, and those actors could be firms, it could be people, it could be households. And you have macroeconomics, which is the study of the economy in aggregate. Macroeconomics. And you get it from their words. Micro, the prefix, refers to very small things. Macro refers to the larger, the bigger picture. And so microeconomics, just to restate it, is essentially how actors make decisions, or I guess we could say allocations, allocations, decisions slash allocations, allocations of scarce resources. And you're gonna hear the word scarce resources a lot when people talk about economics. And a scarce resource is one that you don't have an infinite amount of. For example, love might not be a scarce resource. You might have an infinite amount of love. But a resource that would be scarce is something like food or water or money or time or labor. These are all scarce resources. And so microeconomics is, well, how do people decide where to put those scarce resources? How do they decide where to deploy them? And how does that affect prices and markets and whatever else? Macroeconomics is a study of what happens in aggregate to an economy. So aggregate, what happens in aggregate to an economy from the millions of individual actors? Aggregate, aggregate economy. We now have millions, millions of actors. And it often focuses on policy-related questions. So do you raise or lower taxes? Or what's going to happen when you raise or lower taxes? Do you regulate or deregulate? How does that affect the overall productivity when you do these? So it's policy, top, top-down, top-down questions. And in both macro and microeconomics, especially in the modern sense of it, there's an attempt to make them rigorous, to make them mathematical. So in either case, you can start with some of the ideas, some of the philosophical ideas or the logical ideas that, say, someone like an Adam Smith might have. So you have these, and there are basic ideas about how people think, how people make decisions. So philosophy of people of decision-making, in the case of microeconomics, decision-making. And then you make some assumptions about it, or you simplify it. So I'll do the right, this. You simplify it. And you really are simplifying. You say, oh, all people are rational, or all people are gonna act in their own self-interest, or all people are going to maximize their gain, which isn't true. Human beings are motivated by a whole bunch of things. But you simplify these things so that you can start to deal with it in kind of a mathematical way. So you simplify it so you can start dealing with it in a mathematical sense. And this is valuable. It can clarify your thinking. It can allow you to prove things based on your assumptions. And you can start to visualize things mathematically with charts and graphs, and think about what will actually happen with the markets. So it's very, very valuable to have this mathematical rigorous thinking. But at the same time, it can be a little bit dangerous because you're making these huge simplifications. And sometimes the math might lead you to some very strong conclusions, conclusions which you might feel very strongly about because it looks like you've proven them the same way that you might prove relativity, but they were based on some assumptions that either might be wrong or might be oversimplifications or might not be relevant to the context that you're trying to make conclusions about. So it's very, very, very important to take it all with a grain of salt, to remember that it's all based on some simplifying assumptions. And macroeconomics is probably even more guilty of it. In microeconomics, you're taking these deeply complicated things, the human brain, how people act and respond to each other, and then you're aggregating it over millions of people. So it's ultra complicated. You have millions of these infinitely complicated people all interacting with each other. So it's very complicated. Many millions of interactions and fundamentally unpredictable interactions, and then trying to make assumptions on those, trying to make assumptions, and then doing math with that that could lead you to some conclusions or might lead you to some predictions. And once again, it's very important. This is valuable. It's valuable to make these mathematical models, to make these mathematical assumptions, these mathematical conclusions, but it always needs to be taken with a grain of salt. And so that you have a proper grain of salt and so that you are always focused on the true intuition, and that's really the most important thing to get from a course of economics so that you can truly reason through what's likely to happen, maybe even without the mathematics. I'll leave you with two quotes. And these quotes are a little bit, they're a little bit funny, but they really, I think, are helpful things to keep in mind as you start to especially go deep into the mathematical side of economics. So this right over here is a quote by Alfred Knopf, who was a publisher in the 1900s. An economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible. And I'm assuming when he's talking about the incomprehensible, he's referring to some of the mathy stuff that you see in economics. And hopefully we'll make this as comprehensible as possible and see that there is value in this. But it's a very important statement he's making. Oftentimes it's stating a common sense thing. It's stating something that's obvious. It's obvious, and it's very important to always keep that in mind, to always make sure that you have the intuition for what's happening in the math, or to know when the math is going in a direction that might be strange based on oversimplifications or wrong assumptions. And then you have this quote over here by Lawrence J. Peter, most famous for Peter's Principles, professor at USC. An economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn't happen today. And once again, important to keep in the back of one's mind because especially, and this is especially relevant to macroeconomics, because in macroeconomics, there's all sorts of predictions about the state of the economy, what needs to be done, how long will the recession last, what will be the economic growth next year, what will inflation do? And they often prove to be wrong. In fact, few economists even tend to agree on many of these things. And it's very important to realize that because oftentimes, when you're deep in the mathematics of the economics, it might seem to be a science like physics, but it's not a science like physics. There's open, it is open to subjectivity, and a lot of that subjectivity is all around, is all around the assumptions that you choose to make."
395e5e47-86b9-4a92-8ba8-651b89b1ed93,"The goal of this video is to appreciate how ideas of natural rights and social contract and limited government and popular sovereignty are embedded in America's founding documents. But before we start looking at the documents themselves, let's just make sure we understand the context in which they were written. As we enter into the mid-1770s, you have the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, which begins in 1775. A little more than a year after the beginning of the war, you have the Second Continental Congress decide to formally declare independence on July 2nd, and the Declaration of Independence, which we will study a bit in this video, is formally approved on July 4th, 1776, which is when we now celebrate Independence Day, even though some could argue that it was July 2nd. Now, as soon as the colonies decide that they are independent from the Kingdom of Great Britain, they have to think about how do we govern ourselves. And so within roughly a week, a little more than a week, after the Declaration of Independence is approved, they start drafting the Articles of Confederation. Remember, the Revolutionary War is still going on. Eventually, what will be known as the Articles of Confederation go into effect in 1781. Now, this Articles of Confederation really treat the various colonies as you could almost view it as separate states that agree to work together for purposes of getting independence from Great Britain, for purposes of fighting the war, for purposes of diplomacy. Now, over the course of the next several years, it becomes clear, especially through things like Shay's Rebellion, which we will look at in other videos, that the Articles of Confederation don't provide a strong enough central government. And so in May 1787, you have what is called as the Constitutional Convention convening. It's presided over by George Washington, who led the Americans in the Revolutionary War, which they eventually will win, as you see, and obviously we're an independent country now. And the original intent of the Constitutional Convention was to revise the Articles of Confederation. But folks like Madison and Hamilton were really intent on just completely replacing it. And what they replaced it with was what is now the U.S. Constitution, which goes into effect in March of 1789. And shortly thereafter, you have the beginning of Washington's two terms. And to be clear, the idea of even having a powerful executive, the idea of even having a president, was not present in the Articles of Confederation. That comes with the Constitution. So with that context out of the way, let's look at especially the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. So here's the beginning of the Declaration of Independence, written by Jefferson and edited by Benjamin Franklin and John Adams. And I encourage you to pause this video and first try to read it on your own and see if you can identify these ideas of natural rights, limited government, popular sovereignty, republicanism, and social contract. Okay, let's read this together now. When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with another. Remember, this is a Declaration of Independence. They are dissolving the political bonds with the kingdom of Great Britain. And to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them. So that's starting to refer a little bit to natural rights. A decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. So they're saying, hey, we're writing this document because we're trying to show the rest of mankind why the reasons for which we are deciding to declare our independence from Great Britain. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. Let me underline this. That all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. So this is a direct reference to natural rights. In fact, the phrase life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, most historians believe is in direct reference to John Locke's phrase life, liberty, and property when he talks about natural rights. So this is direct reference to the Enlightenment ideas or even the pre-Enlightenment ideas of natural rights. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. All right, this is worth underlining as well because they're talking about governments being instituted among men to secure these rights. This is all about social contract. So that's social contract. That we form a government in order to secure rights. We might give it some rights, but in exchange, the government has to protect our rights. And they derive their powers from the consent of the governed. So let me write that. Let me underline that actually in a different color. Derive their powers from the consent of the governed. That is popular sovereignty. Popular, I'll just write it as pop-sov. Popular sovereignty right over here. That the people are the sovereigns. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute a new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness. So this is more about social contract. They're like, look, if a government breaks its social contract, we have a right to replace it. And the document also makes reference to organizing its powers in such form. So that's really talking about limited government. They're talking about, hey, this government just won't have the absolute right to do anything. So that right over there is limited government. Prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes. They're essentially saying, look, you shouldn't just overthrow your government on a whim. And accordingly, all experience have shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. So they're saying, look, if you're prudent, you wouldn't just overthrow your government on a whim. But they're kind of saying we're not so worried about that because history has shown us, experience has shown us that if anything, people are more likely to keep suffering even when they should be overthrowing their government. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security. So they're saying, hey, look, the Kingdom of Great Britain, they are abusing us. They are usurping power. Usurping is taking something from you that is yours. And so we need to throw off such a government for our own future security. And here it says provide new guards for their future security. So this provide new guards, once again, making reference to limited government."
888bd883-5f75-45cc-8761-4cdd062fb54e,"What we're going to do in this video is discuss some of the foundational ideas for the United States of America. And we could start at the most foundational of ideas, and that's the notion of natural rights. John Locke, one of the significant Enlightenment thinkers, describes rights like life, liberty, and you might expect me to say pursuit of happiness, which is what we see in the Declaration of Independence, but John Locke refers to life, liberty, and property. But even though his version is a little bit different than what ends up in the Declaration of Independence, most historians believe that Thomas Jefferson was heavily influenced by John Locke's idea of natural rights when Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence. And the idea here is that these are rights that people should be born with, that should never be taken away from them. And in the video on social contract, we talk about the idea of why someone would form a government. They would form a government, they would give some rights to a government in order to protect these basic rights, things like life, liberty, property, the pursuit of happiness. And so you might have some other rights that one would say in a state of nature people might have, the right to do physical harm on others, the right to imprison others, the right to tax others. But in a social contract, we decide, hey, instead of everyone trying to figure out things on their own, let's give these rights to a government. And in exchange, the government should protect, should protect all of these rights for the individuals. And once again, this is review from the social contract video. This is a notion of a social contract. Now the next question is, all right, so if we are willing to engage in this social contract with a government, what type of a government should it be? And throughout most of human history, governments have been things like monarchies, where you have a single individual, maybe a king or queen, an emperor, some type of a conqueror, who is the sovereign, who rules over the state. But you could have, you could, instead of having one, you could have a small group, which would be an oligarchy. Or you could go to the other extreme, where the people are sovereign. And the word for that, and this is a key idea for the United States, is popular, popular sovereignty. The people are sovereign. The government is accountable to the people. Sometimes this could be referred to as democracy. Now the founding fathers of the United States were a little bit suspicious of pure democracy, or direct popular sovereignty. They were afraid that if you start having factions and a majority faction were to come to power, if you have a straight democracy, then they might use that power to strip some of the natural rights of, say, their political enemies or people that they just don't agree with. And so you have this other idea of limited government. Limited government. And some of the key things that limit the government, you could just say generally the rule of law, things like the Constitution, including how the government is structured, the checks and balances in it, the Bill of Rights, clearly is a check on government. And you don't just have limited government when you have a democracy. You could have a limited government even in a monarchy. The United Kingdom is officially a constitutional monarchy where you have a monarch who's sovereign, has very limited powers, because of things like the rule of law. Now the last idea that we're going to talk about in this video is the notion of a republic, or the idea of republicanism. Because the founding fathers didn't actually like calling the United States a democracy. Instead, they favored calling it a republic. And the word republic can mean different things to different people today, depending on what context you use. To some folks today, it means any form of government that's not a monarchy. To other folks, it means, okay, you have a democracy, you have popular sovereignty, but you have limited government. You still have rights that protect minorities, rights that make sure that even if people are not in the majority, they are protected. To the founding fathers, they had a version of this notion of republic. They did view a republic as something that would prevent the passions of an unfettered, pure democracy. But they thought it came mainly by having a representative democracy. That if you had a smaller group of elected representatives, as opposed to everyone getting involved in every issue, that they could calm the passions of the crowds, so to speak. They also thought it was logistically more practical. Sure, ancient Athens could have something closer to a pure democracy, but that was just a small city-state. Well, here, even the 13 colonies were significantly more vast, and obviously, the United States would become even more vast than that. And to appreciate this notion of a republic, right over here is a quote from James Madison in The Federalist Papers number 10. And just for some context on what The Federalist Papers even were, as we mentioned, shortly after the Declaration of Independence, the founding fathers start drafting the Articles of Confederation. They go into effect in 1781. But this is really a loose confederation of states that each individually think of themselves as sovereign states. And it's really a pact that they'll engage in war together, diplomacy together, free trade. But you have Shay's Rebellion, and it's very clear, and we'll talk about this in other videos, that the Articles of Confederation are not powerful enough. And so you have a constitutional convention in mid-1787 in which James Madison is a central figure. Some people discuss him as the father of the U.S. Constitution. They draft what is today the Constitution, but then they have to sell it to the states in order for it to be ratified. Alexander Hamilton has the idea of, hey, why don't we publish a series of papers? And they eventually publish 85 papers, which will collectively be known as The Federalist Papers. And Hamilton writes most of them, but he also recruits James Madison and John Jay. And Federalist Papers Number 10, which is perhaps the most famous, is James Madison's discussion of how do you avoid factions taking over the government and doing things that are not in the interest of the people? And I encourage you to read all of Federalist Papers Number 10, but I have a very small quote here. And this is James Madison's notion of what a republic was, and he thought the United States should be a republic. The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic are, first, the delegation of government in the latter, so he's talking about a republic, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest. So he's really talking about representative democracy, but he thought this was a key component of being a republic. Secondly, the greater number of citizens and greater sphere of country over which the latter may be extended, that only through a representative government could you actually govern over 13 colonies or even beyond 13 colonies. And that's why today, obviously, you might have had something closer to a pure democracy in ancient Athens, which was a city-state, but today, almost any democracy is some form of representative democracy, which James Madison would consider to be a republic. But if you wanted to classify the United States today, a fair term might be it is a democratic republic. You definitely have popular sovereignty. The people are considered sovereign, but they don't rule directly. They rule through representatives, which, by Madison's definition, would make it a republic. So now that you're armed with some of these basic ideas, I encourage you to engage even more with some of the founding documents for the United States. And on top of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, I encourage you to read as many of the Federalist Papers as possible, because it's really an explanation of the ideas behind the U.S. Constitution. And you should start with Federalist Papers number 10. As you'll see, James Madison is quite insightful. He predicts how factions might form, how parties might form, and not always do things in the interest of its people. But I'll leave you to decide whether he was right, whether forming a republic helps this notion of factionalism and look at the world that we are in today and think about whether James Madison would be happy or maybe he would be a little bit uncertain about how things turned out."
3202222b-6ab8-4b17-8e98-0bc468f3c24d,"The entire field of economics is based on the idea of scarcity, and arguably, we wouldn't even need a field of economics if there wasn't the notion of scarcity in the world. So what does scarcity mean? Well, think about it. What does it mean in everyday life? It means that there's not enough of something to go around. If we're talking about scarce goods, scarce services, scarce resources, we're talking about things where if there was no cost associated with them, people would use far more of that than there actually is around. And in this video, we're gonna think about different types of goods and services, or just resources, and think about whether they are scarce or not. So a related idea to scarce resources is its opposite, which is the notion of a free resource. So this is something that you could argue is infinitely abundant, or at least in a certain context, is so abundant that it feels like people can have as much of it as they want. The more that one person has of it, it doesn't take away from someone else. And the reason why scarcity is essential to economics is because economics is the study of how do you allocate these scarce resources. If there's more demand for it than the amount of thing that there is, well, who gets it? How much of it do they get? And what do they have to give up in exchange to get those scarce resources? But for the sake of this video, let's just first make sure we understand and have a good idea of what resources are scarce and which ones aren't and why. So this is a picture of caviar, which is essentially fish eggs. And it's not easy to get. The fish eggs are deep in the water. Someone has to get to them, and then they have to package it in some way, and they have to get it to your plate. And so do you think that caviar is a scarce resource or a free resource? Well, if it was a free resource, that means that we're just swimming in caviar, that it's so abundant that I could just have as much caviar as I want, and there's still as much as you want, and that everyone gets as much caviar as they like. Well, that's clearly not the case. Caviar is a scarce resource. In fact, it is a quite scarce resource. And because of that, if you want it, you have to give up a good bit to get it. This is a picture of some people working in a factory. And the resource that jumps out here is that of labor. And labor's interesting because it's not as tangible as something like caviar, but it is a resource. And one could even argue that the caviar on your plate, some of its scarcity comes from the labor involved of getting it to your plate. But here, these are clearly, it looks like these are gentlemen who are putting together some type of fabric. And so would you consider labor, would you consider that a scarce resource or a free resource? Well, it would be a free resource if people were willing to just do as much work for other people, actually willing to do an infinite amount of work for other people, which isn't even humanly possible. And even if it was humanly possible, people aren't willing to do that. They want something in return. And so once again, it is a scarce resource. There's many resources that are pictured right here. You have this beautiful town next to this alpine lake. And so some clear scarce resources are here. Many people would love to have a view like you would get from this house or hotel right over here, but not everyone, and many people would love to live there because of the view, but not everyone can live there. So that is a scarce resource. The water here is an interesting one. I could imagine in earlier times, if before there was a town here, if there was just a primitive village living next to this fresh water, they would probably view it as a free resource. If someone was thirsty, they would just go up to the lake and they would just drink from the lake. They would not have to give up anything to drink from that. But now the town, it might be a little bit more of a scarce resource. They might wanna preserve it for various reasons. In order to get the water to your sink in your house, there might be some services or goods or labor involved. Someone has to set up the pipes. Maybe it has to be cleaned in some way. Well, then it might become a little bit more of a scarce resource. Air, for most of human history, has been considered a free resource. And even today, I'd argue that something like oxygen, at least on our planet, is considered a free resource. When I take a deep breath, it does not affect your ability to take a deep breath. It does not take oxygen away from you. Now, is there an infinite amount of oxygen in our atmosphere? No, but for our purposes, it feels like there's an infinite amount. Now, if the photosynthetic plants were to disappear and all of a sudden the oxygen started to get diminished, or if we were in a space station where there isn't a seemingly infinite amount of oxygen, well, then you could imagine a world where it could become a scarce resource. You could imagine a colony on the moon or on Mars or in the space station where it had some type of economic system to decide who gets how much oxygen. So I will leave you there. As already mentioned, scarcity is the central idea in all of economics. It's the reason why we even need a field called economics. And as you go forward in your study of both micro and macroeconomics, we'll be looking at ways to allocate these scarce resources. We'll try to study what people have to give up in order to have access to these resources. And we will have models that will help us understand what are the implications for these different methods of allocating resources."
aceda750-1dfa-46b3-8c87-1b11e27978be,"What we're going to do in this video is dig a little bit deeper into the notion of democracy. And the reason why this is going to be valuable is it's going to inform the decisions that the founding fathers had to make when they thought about whether to ratify the Constitution. It'll also inform our thoughts on government as it is today in the United States. What flavor of democracy does it take on, especially at different layers of government? So just as a review, and this is something that we have talked about in other videos, democracy comes from Greek, from rule by the people. Demo from demos, which is referring to people. And krasi coming from kratia, which is referring to rule. So rule by the people. Now broadly speaking, we can think of three general flavors of democracy. The first we can consider to be participatory, participatory democracy. The second we can call pluralist democracy. And I'll define these in a second. And then the third, let's call that elite democracy. Elite democracy. Now what do you think participatory democracy means based on the word participatory? Yes, as you might have guessed, it implies broad participation of the population. Broad participation. What are examples of a participatory democracy? Well, imagine a small town that has maybe a few hundred or a few thousand people. And if there's an issue of whether to build a stoplight at an intersection or change some of the zoning laws, you can imagine a large chunk of the town showing up to weigh in on that decision. Now what are some of the benefits of a participatory democracy and what are some of the negatives? Well, the benefits are, and I'll do those as pluses, a benefit is, well, it kind of seems closest to the original spirit of a democracy. It's coming out of ancient Greece, ancient Athens, the birthplace of democracy, where you did have residents go together and debate the major issues. Although even in ancient Athens, you have to take participation with a grain of salt because it wasn't everyone who was participating. It was, for the most part, wealthy men who had the time to actually sit and debate these issues. But if we wanna give a participatory democracy its credit, say in a small town, is that you really are representing the views of the people. Representing the people well. The people are directly involved. Now what are maybe some of the negatives? Well, it can get logistically difficult. We talked about a small town, but what if the town gets a little bit bigger? Or what if we're dealing with a state or we're dealing with a country where we're talking about tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions or tens of millions of people? How do you get all of those people to weigh in on an issue, even logistically? How do they get informed about it? And are they even prepared to weigh in on those issues? Sure, if you're in a town, you can think about whether an intersection should be there or whether they should put a stoplight there. But if we're talking about matters of national or international importance, influencing hundreds of millions of people, can you depend on people to be informed about the intricacies of the banking system or the military or foreign policy? And so this is really a question of does this scale? And there really aren't any good examples in history of direct democracy scaling in significant ways beyond fairly small groups of people. In the United States, the biggest scale where you might see this are in things like ballot measures at the city or the state level where people are directly voting on certain measures or certain laws. But even there, it's a limited scope for what the people will actually weigh in on. Now, the next category that we talk about is a pluralist democracy. Pluralism is referring to the idea of many different parties, same root as the word plural. You have many things. So you have many different parties and many different competing interests that are going to have a vigorous debate with each other on deciding what are the best ideas. And what are examples of pluralist democracies? If you think about the United States, there are many different interest groups. You could think about all of the different lobbyists, all of the different groups that represent different types of people trying to convince members of Congress either at the national level or even at the state level that their interest is right. Even within Congress, even though you have two major parties, you can have different factions that are really trying to argue it out. Now, what are the benefits of a pluralist democracy? Well, you can imagine that because there's this vigorous debate, maybe the good ideas surface. Good ideas surface. You don't have domination by just one party. No one group, one group or a small group of people, domination. But then on the other side of it, maybe there are some negatives. What might those be? Well, maybe all of this debate and argument is very inefficient. Maybe it takes a, maybe it's slow decision-making. Slow decisions. Or an extreme, no decisions. Some things like gridlock because people can't agree to things that in order for anything to get done, you have to make too many people happy and they all have their interests. Maybe the opposite of good ideas surface. Maybe good ideas die because it's very hard to make everyone happy. Now, the last category that we're gonna talk about is the idea of an elite democracy. And this is where you have more limited participation. So in some ways, it's almost the opposite of a participatory democracy. So this is limited, limited participation. And even though I gave ancient Athens as an example of a participatory democracy, it really was more of an elite democracy where the people had the time and the influence and the money. Those were the ones who were really weighing in on the issues of ancient Athens. And if you were to go to the Roman Republic, the Roman senators, these were, once again, elite men. So what would you think are benefits of an elite democracy? Well, one might be that these elites, so to speak, maybe they are more educated than the general public. And so that allows them to make more informed decisions, especially on things that are quite complex. It would be hard for everyone to weigh in on. If you're gonna change a new accounting standard or think about how do you regulate the telecommunications industry or some very sophisticated trade negotiation or foreign policy negotiation that education might help. And maybe it's also more decisive than either one of the pluralist or the participatory. The participatory, they might be able to appeal to maybe baser instincts, just people's passions, while the pluralists, since you have all of these groups competing, even if something makes sense, they might not be able to make that decision. But if you have a smaller, more limited group, limited participation, maybe they can make these decisions a little bit clearer. But what are the negatives here? Well, the clearest negative is, well, maybe this goes against the whole idea of a democracy. If it's all about the elites, maybe they do a good job at truly representing the interests of the people, but maybe they are good at representing the interests of the elite. So do they really represent the people? Is this a democracy where the people are sovereign, where the people rule? Or is this an oligarchy where only a few people rule and they rule in their own interests? And so after watching this video, look at the world around you. Think about in the United States or whatever country you are watching from, what elements of a participatory democracy do you see? What elements of a pluralist democracy? And what elements of an elite democracy do you see? And as we'll see in other videos, these dimensions of democracy were vigorously debated by the founding fathers when they thought about whether to ratify the Constitution. We'll see this debate when we look at the anti-federalist papers, especially we'll look closely at Brutus number one. We'll see this debate when we look at the Federalist papers, especially Federalist number 10 written by James Madison. And I'll let you decide when we look at that who was right and what flavors of democracy are most dominant in the United States at different levels."
0b9f1def-c30f-43d0-91b9-64e6ce7f5c84,"As we talked about in other videos, shortly after the Declaration of Independence in July of 1776, the representatives from what were colonies but now self-declared states had to think about how to organize themselves. And so they start drafting the Articles of Confederation which go into effect in 1781. Now as we'll see, these Articles of Confederation do not provide for any type of real central government. It really was a mutual defense union with a little bit of free trade, as we'll see in the text here. This is some of the beginning passages of the Articles of Confederation. And I encourage you to read the whole thing. It's actually quite interesting. But you immediately see that it has a very different tone than the one that we see in the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution starts with we the people while the Articles of Confederation starts with to all to whom these presents shall come. So it's almost kind of an awkward business letter. We the undersigned delegates of the states affixed to our names send greeting. Articles of Confederation and perpetual union between the states of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. The style of this confederacy shall be the United States of America. Each, this part is interesting, each state retains its sovereignty. So it rules over itself. It's not giving up its sovereignty to some type of a union. So it retains its sovereignty, its freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled. So they're really viewing themselves as independent countries that are next to each other that for the sake of fighting the Revolutionary War agreed to things like mutual defense and free trade, but they are really separate countries. The said states hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other for their common defense, so this is that mutual defense idea, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other against all force offered to or attacks made upon them or any of them on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretense whatever. And then it says the better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different states in this union, the free inhabitants of each of these states shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several states, and the people of each state shall free ingress and regress to and from any other state, and shall enjoy therein all the privileges of trade and commerce. So people can travel back and forth between these states, there would be free trade, but these would be viewed as different countries. One interesting thing that you don't hear people talk a lot about, there's even a little passage here that allows Canada to join this confederation. Canada, acceding to this confederation and adjoining in the measures of the United States shall be admitted into and entitled to all the advantages of this union, but no other colony shall be admitted into the same unless such admission be agreed to by nine states. So they're saying, hey, if Canada agrees, they are pre-agreeing to allow Canada to join this union, which Canada obviously does not join. But it's interesting to think that they thought about this. Now what are the weaknesses here? Well, the most obvious one, I don't have the entire Articles of Confederation here, but how does this United States of America wield its power? Where does its money come from? It turns out that if it needs to generate revenue in order to take some action, it can't tax the citizens of the states. The states can only do that themselves. Instead, it has to apply to the states in order to contribute to the United States of America. If you wanted to take some type of unified action, well, you would have to have delegates from the various states and meet together and decide what to do. You wouldn't have any strong leader being able to take decisive action. And so there really wasn't a notion of a central government here. There wasn't even a notion of one country, one nation. It really was about different sovereign states. And all of this, as we'll see, will come to a head in the mid-1780s. The United States has a significant amount of debt exiting the American Revolutionary War, debt to countries like France. You also have debt on an individual level. Merchants owe money to European merchants and traders and lenders. And these lenders weren't interested in paper currency from these newly created states. They wanted hard currency. They wanted gold and they want silver. And so many of the merchants in the United States in turn put pressure on the people they lent money to, especially poor farmers, many of whom had been veterans in the Revolutionary War, to pay their debts in hard currency. And so you can imagine these poor farmers who were kind of the bottom of this food chain were in a pretty tough mind. They had fought in the Revolutionary War. They had risked their lives. Many of them had been injured, but they actually did not get paid for their service to a large degree. And then now they were not able to even survive as farmers because not only were they not able to borrow new funds, but some of their existing funds they had to pay back in hard currency which wasn't available in the United States. And so all of this tension eventually comes to a head in Western Massachusetts. This right here is a picture of Daniel Shays who was one of these poor farmers in Western Massachusetts who was also a veteran of the American Revolutionary War who was not paid for his service. And so he eventually becomes one of the leaders of these rebellious former veterans, poor farmers, and they start taking the courthouses of Western Massachusetts, making them inoperable. These are the courthouses where people had to report to in order to talk about how they would repay their debt. Well, you can imagine this worried many of the merchants who these people owed their debt to. It also worried many of the founding fathers because it took some time for the government of Massachusetts to be able to react to this. And while that was happening through mid-1786 and into the beginning of 1787, this rebellion got stronger and stronger and stronger. Eventually, on January 25th, 1787, we see things coming to a head where Daniel Shays is leading his rebels to take the armory in Springfield, Massachusetts, which is in Western Massachusetts, but it's stopped by a militia. This is a militia that's paid for by merchants in the area who probably want their debts paid or just wanted functioning courthouses or did not want all of these rioting farmers and former veterans. And so this rebellion is put down, but it shows the weakness inherent in the Articles of Confederation. This rebellion starts having the potential to spread well beyond Massachusetts, but there was not a coordinated action. In fact, it took many months to even be able to field a militia against the rebellion. It also highlighted the weakness of not having one central government that can take decisive action, also one central government that could generate its own revenue through taxing the citizens of all of the states and using that for things like a military or being able to negotiate debts with foreign countries. And so Shays' Rebellion is cited by many historians as one of the main catalysts after it was put down for having the Constitutional Convention in mid-1787 to rethink the Articles of Confederation. Now, as we talked about in other videos, many people went to this convention thinking, we're not just gonna edit the Articles of Confederation. We need to create a stronger central government. We need a federalist system where, yes, the states can have rights, but we also need a central government. We need a strong leader at the head of that central government. And so they do draft what is now the Constitution at this convention. Then after the convention, they sell this new Constitution, because remember, it has to be ratified by the states through the Federalist Papers, which we also talk about in other videos. Hamilton organized it, but James Madison and John Jay, also significant contributors. And eventually, the Articles of Confederation does get replaced. The Constitution is ratified, and it becomes effective on March 4th, 1789."
e09a5a41-a5cb-4082-a18f-567247a22de5,"An idea that will keep coming up as you study economics is the idea of the four factors of production, which are usually listed as land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. And the idea here is if you want to produce anything, so let's just say this circle is the production process, and this arrow is the output, you need inputs. Now, you might have many, many, many inputs. You might need supplies, you might need a factory, you might need people to work in the factory. You need all of these different things, but the idea of the four factors of production is that these things can all be classified in one of these four groups, as either land, labor, capital, or entrepreneurship. Now, these words have meaning in everyday language, and so some of it might jump out at you. Of course, if you need to build a factory or if you need a farm, you need land to do so. And you can see that in this example here where we see a farm. Clearly, they need a lot of land in order to have the farm. Even in a garment factory, this is a picture of a garment factory from maybe 100 years ago. Even there, they needed land on which to build the factory, so this floor is sitting on land. And land doesn't just have to strictly mean land in an economics context. It can mean natural resources in general. This could be things like water or air or energy. So in some context, instead of land, some people might say natural resources for this first factor of production. Now, another important factor of production, and arguably they are all important, is the idea of labor. To produce many or most things, someone has to work on it. So someone had to plant these seeds and they will have to harvest these crops. The labor is very clear here. You see people putting in work in order to produce the product right over there. Now, capital is an interesting one. It means one thing in everyday language, and it means something slightly more specific when we talk about it in an economics context. In an economic context, capital is something produced to produce other things. So examples of capital would be tools that you use to produce other things. It could be a building that you need in order to produce other things. It could be the machinery in a factory. So in these two pictures, there's many examples of capital. You could view this table and the tools that these folks are using. That is capital. You could view the whole building itself and all of the light fixtures and all of that as capital. So all of this stuff is capital. The hangers that they're putting the coats on after they produce it, that is capital. In this farm example, the capital would be the buildings. These were constructed so that they could produce the food from the farm. This little, it looks like some type of machinery there, that is capital for the farm. It's being used to produce the output of the farm. Now, the place that that's different than everyday language, in everyday language when people talk about capital, they'll often include financial capital, financial assets that could be used to get benefit in the future, things like money. But in an economic context, we are not considering financial assets. We're only thinking about things that were produced in order to produce other things. The fourth factor of production is entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship in our everyday language means putting things together so you're trying to create other things. When someone's an entrepreneur, you might imagine someone who's trying to start a business. In an economic context, it has a related idea. Entrepreneurship is putting together all of the other factors of production so that you can actually produce things. You can't just randomly build buildings and randomly plant seeds. Someone has to think about how do you put these things together so that you can produce things in a reasonable way. And obviously, you wanna produce as much as possible given the other factors that you are putting into the production. A related idea, and it sometimes is used interchangeably in economics course, is technology. So sometimes you'll see the four factors of production is land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship, and sometimes you'll see it listed as land, labor, capital, and technology. But when you see this, when you see technology as a factor of production, don't think about it as technology in everyday language where you think of computer chips or software. When people are talking about technology as a factor of production, they are really talking about entrepreneurship. They're talking about the know-how of putting together the other factors of production in order to produce that output. Finally, I wanna leave on one idea, the idea of the two types of things that could be produced from all of these factors of production. Broadly speaking, we could produce something that could be used to produce more things, and we already talked about it. We could be, in that situation, be producing capital goods. So that could be that we are constructing a factory that itself maybe produces tools for other people to use in some other production process. The other option we have is to produce what are known as consumption goods. Consumption goods. Consumption goods are goods that are just used. It might make people happy. They might find pleasure in it, but it's not being used to produce other things. And because our production resources are scarce, there's a trade-off when a society or a factory or whoever decides how much capital to produce versus how much consumption goods. You need some consumption goods. Otherwise, frankly, we wouldn't have clothing on. We wouldn't be eating nice meals. We wouldn't be able to enjoy our lives. But at the same time, you also need capital. If we did only consumption goods, at some point, we wouldn't have all the things we need to produce the consumption goods. So it's a very interesting trade-off that we'll explore more in future videos."
8e2ad88e-4848-4702-814e-595daf381639,"Hello readers, today I want to talk about themes. A theme is an important idea that is woven throughout a story. It's not the plot or the summary, but something a little deeper. A theme links a big idea about our world with the action of a text. Sometimes a theme answers a question the story is trying to explore, like what does it mean to be a family? Or what are we afraid of? Themes will be statements that answer these questions, like you don't have to be related to someone for them to be your family, or we are afraid of losing our individuality. Now, theme is different from the main idea of a story or its summary. The main idea is what the story is all about, and the summary is the events of the story. It's the plot, it's what happened. But the theme is a lesson or a message that you can take out of the story and apply to your own life. Themes are universal, that is to say anyone can relate to them. So if I tell you a story about how I got food poisoning the one time I ate a sketchy roadside hot dog instead of packing my own lunch, the theme isn't avoid Sticky Pete's hot dogs on Route 91, the theme is it pays to be prepared, because not everyone has a Sticky Pete's, but everyone can be prepared. Ugh, why did I eat it? Why is it green? A theme is similar to a moral, but a moral is more about a specific lesson it's trying to teach you. A theme could be a lesson, but it doesn't have to be. Sometimes you can discover the theme by asking yourself some big questions. What did the characters learn? How did they grow and change? Why did characters act the way they acted? What's different at the end of the story? And what stays with you after the story is over? Let's go through a folktale and see if answering these questions helps us to uncover the theme. This is a story about Anansi the spider. A heroic trickster from West Africa. Anansi was clever, but he wished to be wise. Wiser than everyone, in fact. He decided that he'd take all the wisdom he could find, all the wisdom in the whole world, and gather it all inside a little clay pot. But he didn't like having it in the house, this pot of knowledge. What if our kid knocks it over? He asked his wife, Aso. What if someone comes over in the night and steals it? Who's coming to steal your pot, Anansi? She asked. Nobody even knows you have it. It's not safe, Anansi cried, and he decided to hide it. I'm going out, he said. Don't follow me. Whatever, said Aso, who went back to doing something that was actually useful. Anansi wandered through the forest, lugging this enormous clay pot of wisdom, never aware that his little son, Ntikuma, was following close behind. Not tall enough, said Anansi, looking at a cliff. Not deep enough, he said, frowning at a canyon. Aha, said Anansi, when he came to the prickly thorn tree at the edge of the forest, near a little stream. Now this will do just fine. Anansi had many legs, and he was very strong, but even he could not climb the tree and carry the pot of knowledge at the same time. He scrabbled up the tree, then slid back down again. He wiggled up the tree, then slid back down again. He clambered up the tree. Hey, dad, Anansi's son called out. What, what? I said nobody follow me. What are you doing here, Anansi cried. You should tie the pot to your back, dad. Then you can use all your legs to climb the tree. He was right, but it didn't matter to Anansi. I'll teach you to give me advice, you little miscreant, Anansi yelled, shaking his fist. The same fist that held the handle to the pot full of wisdom. It went sailing into the air as time seemed to slow down. Oh no, said Anansi. Oh no, said Anansi's little son. And the pot smashed open right there in the stream, carrying all of Anansi's carefully gathered up knowledge into the ocean, sending it out to the whole world once again. You are in so much trouble, Ntikuma, Anansi said, clambering back down the tree. And then he said, ow, ow, ow, because in his haste, he had poked himself on the thorns of the tree. His son took off running for home and Anansi raced after him. And as they ran, it began to rain. And as the rain came down, Anansi stopped running and began to walk and think. Ntikuma's plan would have worked after all. When he at last caught up with Ntikuma, he apologized for losing his temper. What was the use of all that wisdom if I can still be outsmarted by my little son, he said. The two of them embraced. And because of Ntikuma's timely interruption, a little bit of Anansi's knowledge lives in us all today. So our questions checklist, what did the characters learn? Well, Anansi learned that even if he had all the wisdom in the world, a child could still have a better idea than him. How did the characters grow and change? Anansi apologized for losing his temper and realized that he wasn't the only person with good ideas. Why did characters act the way they acted? I think Anansi was greedy. Why else would he wanna have all the wisdom in the world and not share it with anybody else? And what's different at the end of the story? At the end of the story, everybody gets a little bit from the pot of wisdom. It flows out into the ocean and gets sent to everybody. And Anansi realized that keeping all the wisdom to himself still didn't make him the wisest all the time. Finally, what stays with you after the story is over? The fact that all of us, you, me, your Aunt Matilda, all of us have a little bit of Anansi's wisdom inside of us. So a theme of this story could be anyone can have a good idea or wisdom is inside all of us. What theme would you give this story? Discuss it with your friends, your classmates, your family, and let us know. The theme of all of my videos is and shall forever be that you can learn anything. David out."
b673dee4-646b-4c75-a992-f4e8bba849ae,"Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy, and today I'm learning more about Article 7 of the U.S. Constitution, which is the provision that specified the conditions for the Constitution to become law. It reads, the ratification of the conventions of nine states shall be sufficient for the establishment of this Constitution between the states so ratifying the same. Although this sounds simple, it reminds us that when the framers finished drafting the Constitution in Philadelphia in 1787, it was by no means a done deal. At least nine states had to ratify the Constitution in order to replace the existing government under the Articles of Confederation. To learn more about the ratification process, I sought out the help of two experts. Mark Graber is the Jacob A. France Professor of Constitutionalism at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law. Michael Rapoport is the Darling Foundation Professor at the University of San Diego School of Law. Professor Graber, can you tell us a little bit about the political context of ratification? What was going on at this time as the framers tried to put a new Constitution into the fabric of the United States? Well, one central problem of the Articles of Confederation was the Articles required that all 13 states consent for any amendment. And it turned out at this time, Rhode Island was a great outlier, so Rhode Island wasn't gonna consent to much of anything. And in fact, Rhode Island did not even send delegates to the convention that drafted the Constitution. So the framers knew that if you had the unanimous rule for ratification, it would not work. So instead they chose nine, it's about 2 3rds, 3 4ths, in part to make sure Rhode Island and one outlier could not prevent adoption. So let's remember there's two stages here in how the Constitution gets written and ratified. So first it's written in what's called the Drafting Convention or the Philadelphia Convention, which was held during the summer of 1787. And in that convention, there was pretty much an agreement that the federal government needed to be made stronger. But that was just a proposal. In order for the Constitution to be ratified, it needed nine of the 13 states. And so it went to the second stage. And there things were in some ways gonna be more difficult because there was a variety of viewpoints in the different states. And the main question that came up in state after state after state was, was the federal government being given too much additional power? Under the previous regime of the Articles of Confederation, the federal government had very limited powers. And the Constitution was gonna give the federal government more power. They wanted a strategy that once the ball started rolling, states that were slower were gonna be faced with a choice. You could get in on the inside and maybe affect some changes early. But if you were left out, whatever happened would happen without you. And a lot of states at the end were fearful of being left out. This strategy worked. And as they went through in tough states, as time went on, so New Hampshire, Virginia, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, in order to get ratification, each time they promised we'll have a Bill of Rights. And those states added a list of amendments that they wanted added to the Constitution. So was it controversial that the framers decided that only nine states would be necessary to ratify the Constitution? Very controversial. One of the central points of anti-federalists was that this was illegal, that the existing Constitution said all states, and therefore only all states could change the Constitution. So in that respect, it was somewhat controversial. Another way in which it departed from the Articles, so the Articles said you needed the state legislatures to approve the amendments. And the U.S. Constitution said no, we want state conventions, special bodies elected by the people to approve these things. Why did they say that? Because they feared that the state legislatures who would be losing a lot of power under the Constitution would vote against it. So they wanted sort of to go directly to the people in these conventions and bypass the state legislatures. So we know that there were some opponents of this new Constitution. How close did they actually come to preventing its ratification? Well, it was a very close fight. We look back on it and eventually all 13 states are gonna ratify and it just looks like, oh, well, that wasn't too much of a trouble. But it was very close and things could have easily gone in the opposite direction. One of the ways in which it was close was that there were just very close votes. Massachusetts was 187 to 168. New Hampshire was 57-47. New York was 30-27. So very close votes in Malta. You know, a couple of people changing their mind and that would have meant various states didn't ratify. In addition to that, some of the states actually did not ratify. So the first thing that happened was Rhode Island, early on in the process, says, we don't like your horrible Constitution. They all expected that. We're not gonna hold even a convention. You want us to hold a convention? We're not gonna hold a convention. We're just gonna have a vote in the state. And that vote in the state, 90% of the people voted against the Constitution. So in a way, Rhode Island actually voted against ratification, although they didn't use the proper method. North Carolina also, they held a convention and they were very upset about there not being a Bill of Rights in the Constitution. And they just didn't approve it. They didn't disapprove it. They just did nothing. And they waited. So in a way, two of the states voted against ratification. North Carolina had not yet ratified when George Washington took office. So in fact, when George Washington took office, there were only 11 states in the union. At the end of the day, crucial people, I think, decided it was better to sign the Constitution and be in on the ground floor than stay out and see what happened. Interesting. So who are some of the major players involved here and what were they arguing about? There were the Federalists who were arguing in favor of ratifying the Constitution and the Anti-Federalists who were arguing against ratifying the Constitution. So the Federalists, two of the very famous ones, are familiar names, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison. Those two people, though, were also particularly important because they decided, Hamilton said, we're gonna have a tough time getting ratification in New York. We need to write some essays defending the Constitution. And so Hamilton and Madison cooperated together and wrote what we now call the Federalist Papers, which were simply essays written in the newspapers trying to urge the New York Convention to ratify the Constitution. Eventually, those essays were sent to other states and became known, and now we come to revere those essays as the Federalist Papers. But they were originally just kind of advocacy pieces for ratifying the Convention. Now, there were also Anti-Federalists. The Anti-Federalists, in part, were simply people who opposed the Constitution. And just as it's the case that, say, people opposed Obamacare from both the left and the right, people who opposed the Constitution opposed it for many different reasons, and one of their problems was they were not a united bunch. But in general, these were people fearful of a very strong national government. They believed states were sovereign, they wanted to keep power local, and they were very fearful of what they perceived to be an elite who would run the Constitution after ratification. The names that people may know who were Anti-Federalists were people like Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams. So what were some of the major arguments made in favor of adopting this new Constitution? There were, I think, two types of arguments. People felt that the Articles were not working properly. They had all kinds of problems. And one of the strongest arguments that the Federalist Papers made was that if we don't fix this and make for a stronger union together, what'll happen is we'll break apart. Look at what happens when you have a bunch of states all next to one another in a land area. We know what that looks like. It's called Europe. And what happens in Europe? They fight wars with one another all the time. And those wars are very problematic. You have to have big armies, standing armies. Now, there were also the particular arguments about what powers were missing that the federal government had. The main arguments were made was the federal government did not have enough power. So they didn't have, for example, the taxing power, and they didn't have a way of enforcing treaties against the states very well. And some of the states were putting tariffs up, so interfering with trade within the country. So states would set tariffs on out-of-state goods. States wouldn't contribute to the national government. Second, we needed to present a united front to foreign governments. So we were very worried. What would happen if South Carolina formed an alliance with England and North Carolina formed an alliance with France? That would be good. The country needed to speak with one voice. So those are some of the arguments made for adopting the Constitution. What were some of the arguments against adopting this new Constitution? Well, first argument was, even though most anti-federalists admitted the Articles needed some repair, they said it's not really urgent. It's not like the House is gonna fall down tomorrow. It's just, you know, the wind is coming through and we can figure it out. We really want a better Constitution. The other arguments were the Constitution put too much power in the national government. It put too much power in elites. The fear was if you had national elections, only elites would win. If you had local elections, people, the people actually knew would win. So they thought a big national government would be too far away from the people to know what they really needed, as opposed to state governments, which they perceived as being sort of more personal, closer to the needs of individuals. So compare two kinds of elections. First, how many people really know anyone who runs for senator, who runs for president, that you're on a first-name basis with? Now compare you're in a school club. Chances are, when someone runs for an officer of the school club, you know who they are. Another type of argument was, if you give the federal government this power, and even if, and the Federalists always argue that the power was limited, that they were being given to the federal government, and the Anti-Federalists came back and said, well, you say it's limited, but what we know from historical experience is that once a government's in power, it tends to seize more power. There's a lot of vague phrases in the Constitution, and the federal government will use those vague phrases to assert greater and greater power. What were some of the strategies that the Framers used to entice some of the opponents of a strong central government to ratify the Constitution? So the first thing that they did was to try to build up momentum. So they knew there were certain states which were strongly in favor of ratification. Small states sometimes wanted ratification. So the first state that comes in is Delaware, and they vote 30 to zero for the Constitution. And a bunch of early states, so let's say the first five states all vote for ratification by pretty lopsided margins. So that builds up a kind of momentum. All right, we have five states. We only need four more. Of course, the next ones that were gonna come were gonna be much more difficult, and they then needed to change their strategy at that point. You know, they argued like crazy. The Federalist Papers are a very famous example. They indicated they'd be open to amendment once the Constitution was ratified. Then again in Pennsylvania, when anti-Federalists boycotted the convention, and the result is the convention didn't have a quorum, they ordered the Sergeant-at-Arms to a tavern. The Sergeant-at-Arms found some boycotting anti-Federalists and physically put them in the building so they could count for a quorum. That's terrific. That one doesn't get told in a whole lot of history books. Wow. The framers could play rough and tumble politics with the best of them. A lot of the things that pop up at the time of the framing, I think we look back on today and imagine how would this work in today's era with 330 million Americans? Do you think the system under the Articles of Confederation with a smaller, more local government could possibly work today? Well, among other things, the Articles had no great means of collecting taxes or gaining revenue. Given that modern government needs trillions of dollars, the Articles, if you got $1,000, it was a miracle. So the Articles clearly don't work. But the Articles were inadequate for 18th century government. They were clearly inadequate or would be clearly inadequate for 21st century government. Now, the Constitution appears to have been adequate for 18th century government. Whether it is adequate for 21st century government is a fair question. One of the interesting questions about the Constitution is how democratic is the Constitution? This debate about how democratic the Constitution is actually enters into the question about ratification. On one level, the Constitution was democratic because each state in these ratification conventions voted on whether to ratify by majority vote. On the other hand, at the federal level, the ratification requirement required nine out of 13. And the idea there would be we needed more buy-in. We needed a limitation on simple majority rule in order to make the system function well, in order to produce a Constitution that would have support from the whole country. The interesting thing about that supermajority rule and something that people don't often make the connection with is we probably owe our Bill of Rights to that supermajority rule. Because if only seven of the 13 states, the mere majority, had been needed to ratify the Constitution, then it's quite possible that the federalists wouldn't have had to promise to put a Bill of Rights into the Constitution because they wouldn't have needed to. And they were initially quite opposed to putting a Bill of Rights in the Constitution. It was only the fact that they needed nine out of the 13 states that really forced their hand and forced them to promise that they would put the Bill of Rights in there. So we see in terms of the ratification that there's both sort of democratic elements but also Republican or supermajority elements. So we've learned that it wasn't easy to ratify the Constitution. The framers bypassed state legislatures and went directly to the people in state conventions, hoping that momentum and arguments for a stronger federal government would entice the opponents of the Constitution to ratify it. It took until 1789 for nine out of 13 states to ratify the Constitution and finally make it law.

dfb97252-8f50-422b-b4ee-94144fa39e5f,"Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy, and today I'm learning more about Article Six of the U.S. Constitution. Article Six is, as we'll soon see, kind of a constitutional grab bag. It covers debts, religious tests for office, and it establishes the Constitution as the supreme law of the land. To learn more about what binds these diverse ideas together, I sought out the help of two experts. Kermit Roosevelt is a professor of law specializing in constitutional law and conflict of laws at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. And Michael Ramsey is professor of law and director of international and comparative law programs at the University of San Diego School of Law. So let's start out talking about the debts portion of Article Six. Professor Roosevelt, why were the framers so interested in debt? What was the historical context that led them to explicitly address debt in Article Six? Well, debt is important generally because nations often need to borrow money. And specifically with the Constitution and the Articles of Confederation, the U.S. government had been borrowing money to pay for the Revolutionary War. So there was a question, we're moving from a sort of loose confederation, almost like a treaty between nations, under the Articles of Confederation, to a single unitary country with a stronger national government under the Constitution. And there's a question, is it still the same country? Will the new United States pay the debts of the old United States? Now, there's a general principle of international law that a successor government undertakes the obligations of the predecessor. So you wouldn't necessarily think this would be a problem, but I think they were particularly concerned because the idea of a republic was a somewhat new one, at least in the 18th century, somewhat unusual one. And the change of a Republican government might cause some worries in Europe where this money was owed. So I think they just wanted to reassure all of the creditors that even if they were changing their method of government, that that wasn't going to affect any of the debts. What might have happened had they decided not to pay those debts? If they decided not to pay the debts, then other countries would probably have been much less willing to lend money to the new United States because they might've thought, well, you know, another change in government could occur. There was substantial question throughout the world whether the United States would be able to survive in the face of all the challenges that they had after gaining their independence. So in order to make it seem that the United States was a country that could be trusted, a country that could be expected to stick around and not collapse into chaos or revert to colonial status, one of the most important things for them was to show that the debts would be honored because a failure to honor debts would suggest that the country did not in fact have true sovereignty and was not prepared to be a actor on the international stage that could be trusted. Another interesting thing to contrast this to is the treatment of debts after the Civil War, where of course the United States, the federal government, paid its own debts, but there's a provision in the 14th Amendment explicitly repudiating the Confederate debt. So if you loaned money to the Confederate States of America, you're never getting that back because we didn't treat that as a valid government that would be continued going forward. Another thing that it illustrates is that the Constitution in some respects was a visionary document that was concerned with the long-term future of the United States, but in other respects, it responded to very immediate practical problems that the framers faced in their day. They were thinking about not just the future of the country for the ages, and they were thinking about that, but they weren't thinking just about that. They were also thinking about reassuring France with respect to the debts that existed right at that moment. So there's a lot going on in Article VI, and specifically, it talks about the Constitution as the supreme law of the land. So what's important about that statement? What's important about that is that it means the Constitution is our highest law. It prevails over any other kind of law in a conflict. So one thing that that means is the Constitution is supreme over state law, and then the Constitution actually goes on to talk about that a little bit more. But it also means the Constitution is supreme over federal law. So everyone is bound by the Constitution. The states can't go against it. Congress can't go past it. The president can't violate constitutional restrictions. The Constitution is really the last word. It's the pinnacle or the keystone of the arch of American democracy. And that's why we can say that things are unconstitutional, that laws are unconstitutional, and therefore, invalid. And most importantly, it's why the Supreme Court can say that laws are unconstitutional and invalid. It creates a superior law that limits the laws that can be passed by the other parts of the government. It creates a hierarchy of laws, and in doing so, it assures that we have a single set of rules that applies to all the states and to the federal government, and it can't be changed except by an amendment, which is relatively difficult to do. There's a procedure in the Constitution for how you can amend the Constitution, but until amended, the Constitution, as written, is our superior law. And that was different from the way that the framers, the rules the framers were used to under the English system, where they didn't have a written Constitution. They had an unwritten Constitution, but that Constitution was subject to change by Parliament. So has the supremacy of the Constitution been tested over time? There haven't been a lot of claims that the Constitution is not supreme. So generally speaking, everyone gives at least lip service to this idea. What's been tested is more the question of who gets to decide what the Constitution means and when something conflicts with it. So if you want the Constitution and federal law to be supreme, probably you would wanna have someone in the federal government deciding when there's a conflict, say, with state law. And the forms that resistance has taken over the years are more states saying, not we can go against the Constitution, we're above the Constitution, but states saying, we don't think what we're doing violates the Constitution, right? And you, the Supreme Court, you think it does, but you're wrong. In the 19th century, just before the Civil War, the Supreme Court decided in the Dred Scott case that African-Americans could not be citizens of the United States, even if they were freed slaves. And President Lincoln believed that that was wrong. He said that there was nothing in the Constitution that denied that, the ability of them to be citizens. And he said that the Supreme Court had misinterpreted the Constitution, and he would not accept the Supreme Court's ruling in that regard. Later, in the 20th century, the Supreme Court held that the Constitution barred segregation, particularly in schools, in the Brown versus Board of Education case. But many Southern governors and other institutions throughout the South thought that the Supreme Court had gotten that one wrong, and they refused to abide by what the Supreme Court had said the Constitution means. What they said was not the Constitution doesn't bind us, but we know what the Constitution means better than you, Supreme Court, you're wrong, you're making this up, it's political, let's not judge it. Another thing that Article VI talks about is religious tests. Why were the framers so interested in preventing religious tests in government? What sort of historical evils were they trying to prevent? So this is connected to the basic idea of the separation of church and state. And you separate church and state, really, to protect both of those things. So you wanna protect religion from being corrupted by political considerations, but you also wanna protect your political system from being a battleground between rival religions. So where this comes from is that in England, they had had a series of what they called test acts. And what the test acts did was it required for people to be eligible for government offices, that people had to be members of the Church of England, and that other religious groups, they were barred by the test acts from holding government office. So actually, many of those minority religions, many adherents of those, ended up coming to the American colonies to gain some measure of religious freedom. The Pilgrims were an example of that. There was a Catholic colony in Maryland. And just generally speaking, many of the people, many of the colonists who came over were people who were not part of the main established church in England. And so you can see why they would not wanna have something like the test acts. And they wanted to make clear that in the new national government, that any religion or no religion would be allowed for government office holders. Do you think it's true that we don't have religious tests or oaths in the United States? How about the practice of swearing on a Bible during the presidential inauguration? Well, the practice of swearing on a Bible is very interesting, as is the fact that when the president recites the oath of office, every president, going back to George Washington, has added on to the end of it, so help me God. There's actually an oath in the constitution the president has to swear to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution. But the constitution doesn't say, so help me God. The presidents just add that on on their own. And actually that sort of illustrates the way in which the constitution treats religion, which is it can't be part of government in an official sense. But we know that members of government are also people and they have religious beliefs that are important to them. And we don't demand that they exclude religion from their lives. We just demand that it be separated from government authority. So you can swear on a Bible if you want to. You don't have to. You can swear on some other religious book. We had a member of Congress take an oath of office on a Quran. So individual government officials are allowed to include religion insofar as it's about them personally. You know, what you think is appropriate to mark this occasion? What solemnifies this oath for you? You can do that. But we can't require it and they can't make the exercise of their power religious in nature. So you can't, you know, as a government official, exercise your power on religious grounds. Something that strikes me about Article VI is that it addresses so many different things. Do you have a sense of why debts and constitutional supremacy and religious tests are all in one article? Article VI, as you said, is a little bit of a grab bag. It's not entirely clear how these different pieces of Article VI relate to each other. And I think they were just things that the framers wanted in the Constitution and didn't know for sure where else to put them. I'm not exactly sure why the debts are there. If I had to say something about Article VI, it's sort of the glue that holds the constitutional architecture together. So maybe the debts are in there to explain the continuity between the US government under the Articles of Confederation and the US government under the Constitution. Then the Supremacy Clause explains how all of the different parts of the federal system are supposed to fit together. And what the Supremacy Clause is saying is the Constitution is above all of them. The Constitution connects them all. Everyone has to abide by the Constitution. And it tells you the Constitution is the highest law, then you've got federal law, and then below that is state law. So that if there's a conflict between federal law and state law, the federal law is gonna win. And then the last part of Article VI is sort of doing the same thing. Because what holds a country together? What binds people into a single people? In a lot of countries at the time of the founding, it was religion. Religion was the glue that held the society together. And if you weren't a member of that religion, you were an outsider, you were a second-class citizen, you would be shunned and not given equal rights in some ways. The last clause of Article VI says something sort of similar about America, except it explicitly says it's not religion that binds us together, right? No religious test can be required. But you do have to take an oath. What do you have to pledge to support? You have to pledge to support the Constitution. So there again, it's telling you the Constitution is what we all have in common. That's what makes us Americans. That really is the glue that binds our society together. So we've learned that Article VI is, as Professor Roosevelt put it, the glue that binds the country together. In assuming the debts from the era of the Articles of Confederation, Article VI established the continuity of US government. It also placed the Constitution, not religion, as the supreme law of the United States.

6fb2646b-e393-4473-a4dd-e5deb24ad6c2,"In this video, we're going to dig a little bit deeper into the notion of perfectly competitive markets. So we're gonna think about under what scenarios a firm would make an economic profit or an economic loss in them. Now as a reminder, these perfectly competitive markets are something of a theoretical ideal. There's few markets in the real world that are truly perfectly competitive. Some might get close, but most markets are someplace in a spectrum between perfectly competitive and at the other extreme, say something like a monopoly. But here we're talking about perfect competition. And in perfect competition, the firm's products aren't differentiated. There's no barriers to entry or exit. And so in that situation, the market supply and demand curves are going to define the price in the market, which are also going to define the marginal revenue for these firms. They're all going to be price takers. They're gonna be passive in terms of price. Whatever the market price is, that's the price that they are going to sell their products for. And their decision is really what quantity to produce and sell, and whether to enter or exit the market. So let's look at that a little bit. So these are just your classic and supply and demand curves you might see for a market. The first few units in the market, there's a huge marginal benefit, so people are willing to pay a lot. But then each incremental unit, the marginal benefit's a little bit lower and lower and lower and lower, and that's why we have that downward sloping demand curve. And then on the supply curve, the first unit in the market might be fairly inexpensive to produce, but then the marginal cost gets higher and higher and higher. And where they meet, where the supply and demand meet, that tells us the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity in the market. And we can show that with that line, and let's just say that equilibrium price is $10. And as I just mentioned, that's going to have to be the price that all of the firms, and these might not be all of the firms in the market, but all of the firms in the market, if we're talking about a perfectly competitive market, would just have to take that price. So given that, what quantity would firms A, B, and C produce, and which of these firms would be profitable or not? I encourage you to pause the video and think about those two questions. If you could just answer which of these firms would be profitable or not, and we're talking about economic profit in this context. All right, well let's look at firm A first. Well, firm A, for any of them, it is not rational to produce a quantity where the marginal cost is higher than the marginal revenue that the firm's getting. And remember, this line right over here, this line right here, which is the price line, that's also, that is price, which is equal to marginal revenue. And so for that extra unit, if you can't sell it for more than you're producing, you wouldn't produce that extra unit. So it's rational for them to produce more and more and more. The marginal cost goes higher and higher until right at the point that marginal cost is equal to marginal revenue, which is equal to price, the market price, which they're just going to take. So it's rational for this firm to produce this quantity right over here. So I'll just go quantity, I'll say quantity for that firm. Now is this firm going to be profitable or not? Well, this quantity, what's its average total cost? Well, its average total cost is right over there. And so for every unit, it's going to make this difference between the price or the marginal revenue it's getting and its average total cost. And so one way to think about the profit of this firm is, and we're talking about economic profit, it's going to be the area of this rectangle right over here. So let's say if the average total cost at that quantity is, let's say that this is $8, then this height of the rectangle is 10 minus eight, the height right over here, let me do this in a different color, this height right over here is $2, and then the width is going to be the quantity of that firm. And so let's say the quantity of that firm, let's say it's 10,000 units a year, 10,000, 10,000 units per year. And so the area right over here would be $2 times 10,000. It would be $20,000, $20,000 per time unit, if we're talking all of this is, say, per year. Now let's go to firm B. Using that same analysis, is firm B making an economic profit or is it not making an economic profit? Well, firm B is once again going to be a price taker. And so the price right over here, the equilibrium price of the market, is going to be equal to the price that that firm has to take, which is going to be its marginal revenue curve. And that's why it's a flat marginal revenue curve, because no matter what quantity they produce, they're gonna get that same price. And it wouldn't be rational for them to produce a quantity where marginal cost is higher than marginal revenue. And so they would produce right over there. Now what is their economic profit at this quantity? So this is quantity of the second firm, firm B. I'll write it like that. Maybe that is firm A. And maybe this is also, it looks about the same. I'll make them a little bit different. Let's say that's 9,500 units per time period. Well, here the average total cost at that quantity is equal to the marginal cost, so which is equal to the marginal revenue. So at that quantity, whatever that $10 they're getting per unit, they're also spending on average $10 per unit. Another way to think about it, the area of that rectangle is going to be zero because it has no height. So this situation right over here, the firm has zero economic, I'll write zero dollars of economic profit. And then last but not least, let's think about firm C. Pause this video and think about what its economic profit would be. Well, like we've seen, it would be rational for it to produce the quantity where marginal cost is equal to marginal revenue, which is equal to the market price. So it would produce this quantity right over here. And let's say that that quantity is 9,000 units. And what's its average total cost then? So at 9,000 units, its average total cost, let's say that that is $12 right over there. So what's its economic profit? So for every unit it's selling, it's getting $10 and it's costing $12 on average to produce it. So it's taking an economic loss of $2 per unit. So $2 per unit, so this height right over here is $2, times the units times 9,000, you're going to have two times 9,000, you're going to have an $18,000 not economic profit, but economic, economic loss. Now, one thing to think about is why would any firm be in this situation? Well, it's important to think about things in the short run versus the long run. In the short run, we've talked about this analysis right over here, where a firm can decide what quantity it would produce that is rational. Its fixed costs are fixed in the short run. We've studied that in multiple videos. But in the long run, its fixed costs aren't fixed, and so the firm could decide to enter or exit the market. And so for firm C, while they've already put in those fixed costs, it is actually rational for them to do it because they're actually able to make the marginal revenue they get up to that quantity, it's at least they're able to more than cover their marginal costs, and then they're able to eat up, or I guess you could say take care of some of their fixed costs, but they're still not able to run an economic profit. So in the long run, it wouldn't be rational for this firm to stay in the market. They would likely exit the market."
75e03545-1fa1-48a0-a963-8e0aa17d48a4,"What we're going to do in this video is talk about two related ideas that are really the foundations of economics. The idea of scarcity and the idea of rivalry. Now in other videos, we do a deep dive into what scarcity is, but just as a review, in everyday language, you could think of something is scarce, a good or a service is scarce if there's not enough for everyone. Another way to think about it is a scarce resource is one that is limited. It is a limited resource and there's not enough to go around because there are potentially unlimited wants from people. So potentially, potentially unlimited, unlimited wants. And we could think of a lot of scarce resources. Oil would be a scarce resource. There's a limited supply of oil and potentially, if oil were free, there's an unlimited amount of people who would want to use that oil. And so a lot of economics is, well, when you have a scarce resource like oil or land or housing, how do you allocate those resources amongst people, people who are demanding those resources? Now rivalry is a related idea. When we think about the everyday word rival or rivalry, you imagine multiple parties competing for something and that's essentially getting pretty close to the economics definition of it. Something is a rival good or a rival resource. I'll just call it a rival good right now if when one person uses it, it limits the ability for other people to use it. So one person consuming it or using it, consuming it limits ability for others to use. And there's a lot of examples of rival goods and things that are both scarce and rival goods. For example, if I were to put a nice, delicious cake that could only serve four people in our office here at Khan Academy where we have 80 or 90 folks work, well, you can imagine that cake's going to be a rival good. It's also a scarce good because many people, many more people are gonna want that cake than the amount of cake we have. But when you look at what the definition of a rival good is, every time if I eat the whole cake, that's going to limit other people's ability to use it. And economists will sometimes create a spectrum of how rivalrous a good is. So for example, let me draw a spectrum right over here. So on this line, so on the left-hand side, I will call this highly rivalrous, which they'll actually use that word, but I'll just call this rival goods. And then at the other extreme here, I'll say non-rival, non-rival good. And at the left end, it's pretty easy to come up with a bunch of rival goods. If you're living in a place where housing is tight, where all of the housing is taken up, housing is often a rival good. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and when a house goes on rent, you'll have multiple people who are competing for that house or if it's going for sale. And so when one person gets it and gets to live there, well, that's gonna make it hard for other people to use it. You could imagine, you know, land in a lot of urban areas is a rival good. You could imagine something like, you know, a cake, especially if there's not a lot of cake to go around at a birthday party. Now, what would be the other extreme? What would be a non-rival good? Well, there are very few perfectly non-rival goods, but there are things that are close to it because at least relative to where people's, where people are trying to use it today, it seems like there's almost an unlimited supply of it. One example might be something that's close. I'm not gonna put it all the way at the end. I'm gonna put air, air to breathe on Earth. Now, right now, it's a non-rival good. When I take a deep breath, it doesn't make it hard for you to take another simultaneous deep breath. And actually, let me put a little qualifier here, simultaneously, simultaneously. That's actually a key qualifier for a rival good. So for example, a hammer is also a rival good because if I'm using it right now, it becomes very hard for you to use it simultaneously. Now, as I mentioned, air to breathe, if I take a deep breath right now, it doesn't make it any harder for you to take a deep breath. But if you were to take an extreme circumstance that, let's say that if we were in a closed room with a limited supply of oxygen, well, then the air might become something closer to a rival good. So let me put it this way. Air to breathe outside, while here I'll put air in, airtight, let me put oxygen in an airtight container or airtight room. Oxygen in airtight room, or maybe a room that is running out of oxygen. Well, then every time I take a breath, it's gonna make it harder for you to take a breath and vice versa. There's other things like, well, roads are rival goods, especially if we're talking about rush hour. So let me put this right over here. So let's call this the roads during rush hour. Roads during rush hour. The more people that are on the roads, it's gonna make it harder for other people to use it simultaneously. We'll get all this traffic. People won't even be able to get on the highway because there's so much gridlock. But then you could imagine roads in the middle of the night are non-rival goods. If I decide to take a drive at three in the morning on most highways, it doesn't make it any harder for another person to take a drive on that highway simultaneously. So let me put it over here. Roads at 3 a.m. in most places is closer to being a non-rival good. So I will leave you there. These are ideas that we're going to keep revisiting in economics, but it's good to have a sense of what they mean, and then it'll inform how we think about allocating these scarce goods amongst folks and thinking about how we allocate these rival goods amongst various parties."
d5a0420f-698c-4d71-9265-06745f785afb,"As we talked about in other videos, shortly after the Declaration of Independence in July of 1776, the representatives from what were colonies but now self-declared states had to think about how to organize themselves. And so they start drafting the Articles of Confederation which go into effect in 1781. Now as we'll see, these Articles of Confederation do not provide for any type of real central government. It really was a mutual defense union with a little bit of free trade, as we'll see in the text here. This is some of the beginning passages of the Articles of Confederation. And I encourage you to read the whole thing. It's actually quite interesting. But you immediately see that it has a very different tone than the one that we see in the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution starts with we the people while the Articles of Confederation starts with to all to whom these presents shall come. So it's almost kind of an awkward business letter. We the undersigned delegates of the states affixed to our names send greeting. Articles of Confederation and perpetual union between the states of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. The style of this confederacy shall be the United States of America. Each, this part is interesting, each state retains its sovereignty. So it rules over itself. It's not giving up its sovereignty to some type of a union. So it retains its sovereignty, its freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled. So they're really viewing themselves as independent countries that are next to each other that for the sake of fighting the Revolutionary War agreed to things like mutual defense and free trade, but they are really separate countries. The said states hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other for their common defense, so this is that mutual defense idea, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other against all force offered to or attacks made upon them or any of them on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretense whatever. And then it says the better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different states in this union, the free inhabitants of each of these states shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several states, and the people of each state shall free ingress and regress to and from any other state, and shall enjoy therein all the privileges of trade and commerce. So people can travel back and forth between these states, there would be free trade, but these would be viewed as different countries. One interesting thing that you don't hear people talk a lot about, there's even a little passage here that allows Canada to join this confederation. Canada, acceding to this confederation and adjoining in the measures of the United States shall be admitted into and entitled to all the advantages of this union, but no other colony shall be admitted into the same unless such admission be agreed to by nine states. So they're saying, hey, if Canada agrees, they are pre-agreeing to allow Canada to join this union, which Canada obviously does not join. But it's interesting to think that they thought about this. Now what are the weaknesses here? Well, the most obvious one, I don't have the entire Articles of Confederation here, but how does this United States of America wield its power? Where does its money come from? It turns out that if it needs to generate revenue in order to take some action, it can't tax the citizens of the states. The states can only do that themselves. Instead, it has to apply to the states in order to contribute to the United States of America. If you wanted to take some type of unified action, well, you would have to have delegates from the various states and meet together and decide what to do. You wouldn't have any strong leader being able to take decisive action. And so there really wasn't a notion of a central government here. There wasn't even a notion of one country, one nation. It really was about different sovereign states. And all of this, as we'll see, will come to a head in the mid-1780s. The United States has a significant amount of debt exiting the American Revolutionary War, debt to countries like France. You also have debt on an individual level. Merchants owe money to European merchants and traders and lenders. And these lenders weren't interested in paper currency from these newly created states. They wanted hard currency. They wanted gold and they want silver. And so many of the merchants in the United States in turn put pressure on the people they lent money to, especially poor farmers, many of whom had been veterans in the Revolutionary War, to pay their debts in hard currency. And so you can imagine these poor farmers who were kind of the bottom of this food chain were in a pretty tough mind. They had fought in the Revolutionary War. They had risked their lives. Many of them had been injured, but they actually did not get paid for their service to a large degree. And then now they were not able to even survive as farmers because not only were they not able to borrow new funds, but some of their existing funds they had to pay back in hard currency which wasn't available in the United States. And so all of this tension eventually comes to a head in Western Massachusetts. This right here is a picture of Daniel Shays who was one of these poor farmers in Western Massachusetts who was also a veteran of the American Revolutionary War who was not paid for his service. And so he eventually becomes one of the leaders of these rebellious former veterans, poor farmers, and they start taking the courthouses of Western Massachusetts, making them inoperable. These are the courthouses where people had to report to in order to talk about how they would repay their debt. Well, you can imagine this worried many of the merchants who these people owed their debt to. It also worried many of the founding fathers because it took some time for the government of Massachusetts to be able to react to this. And while that was happening through mid-1786 and into the beginning of 1787, this rebellion got stronger and stronger and stronger. Eventually, on January 25th, 1787, we see things coming to a head where Daniel Shays is leading his rebels to take the armory in Springfield, Massachusetts, which is in Western Massachusetts, but it's stopped by a militia. This is a militia that's paid for by merchants in the area who probably want their debts paid or just wanted functioning courthouses or did not want all of these rioting farmers and former veterans. And so this rebellion is put down, but it shows the weakness inherent in the Articles of Confederation. This rebellion starts having the potential to spread well beyond Massachusetts, but there was not a coordinated action. In fact, it took many months to even be able to field a militia against the rebellion. It also highlighted the weakness of not having one central government that can take decisive action, also one central government that could generate its own revenue through taxing the citizens of all of the states and using that for things like a military or being able to negotiate debts with foreign countries. And so Shays' Rebellion is cited by many historians as one of the main catalysts after it was put down for having the Constitutional Convention in mid-1787 to rethink the Articles of Confederation. Now, as we talked about in other videos, many people went to this convention thinking, we're not just gonna edit the Articles of Confederation. We need to create a stronger central government. We need a federalist system where, yes, the states can have rights, but we also need a central government. We need a strong leader at the head of that central government. And so they do draft what is now the Constitution at this convention. Then after the convention, they sell this new Constitution, because remember, it has to be ratified by the states through the Federalist Papers, which we also talk about in other videos. Hamilton organized it, but James Madison and John Jay, also significant contributors. And eventually, the Articles of Confederation does get replaced. The Constitution is ratified, and it becomes effective on March 4th, 1789."
1473779b-8fa5-4699-8d75-5dd55329b840,"In the last video, we gave a bit of an overview of potassium-argon dating. In this video, I want to go through a concrete example. It'll get a little bit math-y, usually involving a little bit of algebra or a little bit of exponential decay but to really show you how you can actually figure out the age of some volcanic rock using this technique, using a little bit of mathematics. So we know that anything that is experiencing radioactive decay, it's experiencing exponential decay, and we know that we can, there's a generalized way to describe that and we go into more depth and kind of prove it in other Khan Academy videos. But we know that the amount as a function of time, so if we say n is the amount of a radioactive sample we have at some time, we know that's equal to the initial amount we have, we'll call that n sub zero, times e to the negative kt, where this constant is particular to that thing's half-life. And to figure it out, and we're gonna do this for the example of potassium-40, we know that after, when time is 1.25 billion years, that the amount we have left is half of our initial amount. So let's write it that way. So let's say when we start with n naught, we start with n naught, whatever that might be, it might be one gram, kilogram, five grams, whatever it might be, whatever we start with, we take e to the negative k times 1.25 billion years, that's the half-life of potassium-40, so 1.25 billion years, we know after that long that half of the sample will be left. So we will have 1.5 n naught left. Whatever we started with, we're going to have half left after 1.25 billion years, divide both sides by n naught, divide both sides by n naught, and then to solve for k, we can take the natural log of both sides, so you get the natural log of 1.5, we don't have that n naught there anymore, is equal to the natural log of this thing. The natural log is just saying, to what power do I have to raise e to get e to the negative k times 1.25 billion? So the natural log of this, the power that I have to raise e to to get to e to the negative k times 1.25 billion is just negative k times 1.25 billion. I could write it as negative 1.25, let me write it times 10 to the ninth, times 10 to the ninth k. That's the same thing as 1.25 billion, we have our negative sign and we have our k. And then to solve for k, we can divide both sides by negative 1.25 billion. And so we get k, and I'll just flip the sides here, k is equal to the natural log of 1.5 times negative 1.25 times 10 to the ninth power. And what we can do is we can multiply the negative times the top, or you can view it as multiplying the numerator and the denominator by a negative so that the negative shows up at the top. And so we could make this as over 1.25 times 10 to the ninth, this is 1.25 billion. And negative, let me write it over here in a different color. The negative natural log, well I could just write it this way. If I have a natural log of b, we know from our logarithm properties this is the same thing as the natural log of b to the a power. So the negative natural log of 1.5 is the same thing as the natural log of 1.5 to the negative one power. And so this is the same thing. Anything to the negative one power is just this multiplicative inverse. So this is just the natural log of two. So negative natural log of 1.5 is just the natural log of two over here. So we were able to figure out our k. It's essentially the natural log of two over the half-life of this substance. So we could actually generalize this if we were talking about some other radioactive substance. And now let's think about a situation, now that we've figured out a k, let's think about a situation where we find in some sample, so let's say the potassium that we find, let's say it is one milligram. I'm just gonna make up these numbers. And let's say, and usually these aren't measured directly and you really care about the relative amounts, but let's say you're able to figure out the potassium is one milligram, and let's say that the argon, actually, let me say the potassium 40 found, and let's say the argon 40 found, let's say it is 0.01, 0.01 milligram. So how can we use this information, what we just figured out here, which is derived from the half-life, to figure out how old this sample right over here? How do we figure out how old this sample is right over there? Well, what we need to figure out, we know that n, the amount we were left with, is this thing right over here. So we know that we're left with one milligram. So we know that what we have left is one milligram. And that's going to be equal to some initial amount, it's going to be some initial amount, and we'll use both of this information to figure that initial amount out, times e to the negative kT. And we know what k is, and we'll figure it out later. So k is this thing right over here. So we need to figure out what our initial amount is. We know what k is, and then we can solve for T. How old is this sample? And to figure out our initial amount, we just have to remember that for every argon-40 we see, that must have decayed from, when you have potassium-40, 11% decays, when it decays, 11% decays into argon-40, and the rest, 89%, decays into calcium-40. We saw that in the last video. So however much argon-40, that is 11% of the decay product. So if you want to think about the total number of potassium-40s that have decayed since this was kind of stuck in the lava, and we learned that anything that was there before, any argon-40 that was there before would have been able to get out of the liquid lava before it froze, or before it hardened. So to figure out how much potassium-40 this is derived from, we just derive it, we divide it by 11%. So maybe I could say k initial, the potassium-40 initial is going to be equal to the amount of potassium-40 we have today, one milligram, plus the amount of potassium-40 we needed to get this amount of argon-40. So we have this amount of argon-40, .01 milligrams, and that, the number of milligrams there, it's really just 11% of the original potassium-40 that it had to come from. The rest of it turned into calcium-40. So we divide it by 11%, or 0.11. And I'm doing, this isn't the exact number, but it'll get the general idea. And so our initial, which is really this thing right over here, I could call this N naught. I could call this N naught. This is going to be equal to, and I won't do any of the math, so we have one milligram we have left, is equal to one milligram, which is what we found, plus 0.01 milligram, over 0.11, and then all of that times e to the negative kt. And what you see here is, when we want to solve for t, assuming we know k, and we do know k now, that it really, the absolute amount doesn't matter. What actually matters is the ratio, because if we're solving for t, you want to divide both sides of this equation by this quantity right over here. So you get this side, the left-hand side, divide both sides, you get one milligram over this quantity, I'll write it in blue, over this quantity is going to be one plus, I'm just going to assume, actually, that the units here are milligrams. So you get one over this quantity, which is one plus 0.01 over the 11%, that is equal to e to the negative kt. And then you want to take, if you want to solve for t, you want to take the natural log of both sides. So then you get, so this is equal right over here. You want to take the natural log of both sides, so you get the natural log of one over one plus 0.01 over 0.11, or 11%, is equal to negative kt. And then to solve for t, you divide both sides by negative k. So I'll write it over here. You can see this is a little bit cumbersome mathematically, but we're getting to the answer. So we got the natural log of one over one plus 0.01 over 0.11 over negative k. Well, what is negative k? We're just dividing both sides of this equation by negative k. Negative k is the negative of this over the negative natural log of two over 1.25 times 10 to the ninth. And now we can get our calculator out and just solve for what this time is, and it's going to be in years, because that's how we figured out this constant. So let's get out my handy TI-85. And so first I'll do this part. So this is one divided by one plus 0.01 divided by 0.11. So that's this part right over here. That gives us that number. And then we want to take the natural log of that. So let's take the natural log of our, this is just our previous answer. So natural log of 0.9166667 gives us negative 0.087. So that's this numerator over here. And we're going to divide that. So this number is our numerator right over here. We're going to divide that by the negative, I'll use parentheses carefully, the negative natural log of two, that's that there, divided by 1.25 times 10 to the ninth. So it's negative natural log of two divided by 1.25. E9 means times 10 to the ninth. And I closed both parentheses. And now we need our drum roll. So this should give us our T in years. And we get, let's see how many. This is 1,000, so it's 3,000. So we get 156 million or 156.9 million years if we round. So this is approximately, or I could just say approximately 157 million years old sample. So the whole point of this, I know the math was a little bit involved. But it's something that you would actually see in kind of a pre-calculus class or an algebra 2 class when you're studying exponential growth and decay. But the whole point I want to do this is to show you that it's not some crazy voodoo here. And Sal gave this very high level explanation. And then you say, oh, well, there must be some super difficult mathematics after that. The mathematics really is something that you would see in high school. And if you saw a sample that had this ratio of argon 40 to potassium 40, you would actually be able to do that fairly high school mathematics. You would be able to do that to figure out this is 157 million year old sample of volcanic rock."
867fd98d-a5ea-4444-b0b1-ffce5a2ff361,"In this video, I'm going to use words like eras, periods, and ages to refer to segments of time in the human or in the pre-human past. And what I want to clarify right from the get-go, because frankly this is something that's confused me in the past, is that archaeologists will refer to eras, periods, and ages in the human past, and they're usually referring to periods of tens of thousands of years or thousands of years. But these are different eras, periods, and ages than the ones that geologists would refer to when they're talking about geological time. In geological time, era means several hundred millions of years. Periods and ages mean millions of years. When archaeologists, when we're starting the human past, they're just generally talking about long segments of human time, but not in the millions of years, usually in the thousands or the 10,000s of years. So what I want to do with that out of the way is talk about what has happened in the distant human past or the distant pre-human past, and also touch on some of the classifications for these segments of time, because they actually tell us what were the interesting developments that happened to humanity over the 200,000 years that Homo sapiens have been on this planet, or that we believe that Homo sapiens have been on this planet. So the longest period of time in human past, or the category of human time, and there's different ways you can categorize it, is the Paleolithic Era right over here, and what really makes that period of time. So this begins even in pre-history or pre-human history, so before Homo sapiens even existed, you have the beginning of the Paleolithic Era that really began with the development of stone tools, and as we learned in the video on human evolution, there were pre- Homo sapiens species that were using stone tools. And so the Paleolithic Era, it's really kind of signified by, one, the stone tools, but even more, that either the pre-humans, or once you go about 200,000 years ago, the humans showed up, it's kind of distinguished by humans being hunter-gatherers, which essentially means to survive. We used to walk around a lot, if we couldn't see something obvious to hunt, maybe a woolly mammoth or something, if we didn't see something obvious to hunt, we would look around for snails or mushrooms or whatever else, and that's how we would survive, that's how we would live. And because we were constantly adapting to our environment based on the seasons, we were maybe following animals as they migrated, hunter-gatherers were fundamentally nomadic, which means that they never settled in one place for a long time. They were always ready to kind of pick up, probably, their tents and follow the herd, or follow whatever animals they were hunting, or follow the seasons so they could go to warmer climates, maybe where there's more likely to find on the ground to eat, maybe, during the winter, or who knows. And so the Paleolithic Era is really distinguished by that. It's a huge swath of time in human history, and it doesn't come to an end until you get to the advent of farming. So the Paleolithic Era, I mean, we're literally talking about over 2 million years ago is when it starts, before Homo sapiens even existed as a species, and it goes all the way to the advent of farming that we believe first came about around 11,000 to 7,000 years ago. And this abbreviation right here, this BP, this does not stand for British Petroleum. It stands for Before Present, or Before the Present Time. So one more acronym to kind of have in your toolkit when you see things. And obviously, if we're 11,000 years before the present, that's the same thing as 9,000 years before Christ, or before the Common Era, because Christ was, we believe, born 2,000 years ago. Now, it may or may not be obvious to you, but the advent of agriculture is a super big deal. Arguably, the biggest deal in the development of human civilization, or in all of human history. And you might say, hey, what's the big deal about agriculture? These characters over here look pretty happy. They're able to walk around a lot. They're able to hunt. What's the big deal of all of a sudden people plowing fields and domesticating cattle and having chickens to lay eggs and whatever else? And the big deal about that, besides the fact that it would change people's diet, is that for the first time, it allowed them to not be nomadic. And you could have probably had some hunters who were somewhat settled, maybe living near the ocean. Maybe they did some fishing and all the rest. But for the most part, with the development of agriculture, it forced people to stay in one place. So you have the Paleolithic era all the way to the advent of agriculture, which was about 11,000 to 7,000 years ago, and besides the fact that it changed people's diet, it allowed them to settle. So agriculture allowed human beings to settle down in one area. And it wasn't just that they were settling in one area, but because they were able to control their environment. They were able to increase the density of things, of crops that humans could consume, and animals that humans could consume, and lower the density of crops that humans can't consume, and animals that they can't consume, or that they don't want around, like pests of some type. What it allowed them to do is also settle in more dense environments. You can imagine, when you just have people walking around, you need a lot of land to support even the calorie requirements of one human being. But all of a sudden, if you are able to develop agriculture, you're able to domesticate animals, all of a sudden you can have, in the same amount of land, you can have more calories being generated. And because you have more calories being generated in a smaller amount of land, people can settle, and they can settle in a denser environment. And so agriculture was really this necessary requirement for people to kind of develop civilization, or to develop villages, and cities, and maybe also giving them the free time to start thinking about, hey, maybe we want to think about how we can record what we know, how we can develop even more technologies. And so just to give us a sense of the categorization that an archaeologist would use for these different periods of time, I told you we start with the Paleolithic era, with the advent of stone tools, pre-humans, most of human time on this planet, and then about 11,000 years ago, the development of agriculture, and it developed independently at different places around the world, which is by itself an interesting phenomenon. People think that it might just be that the climate might have warmed up a little bit, so that people, maybe naturally there were some human edible crops that existed in a little bit of a denser environment, and humans learned to optimize that slowly, and they did that independently. But it's an interesting question of why did it develop just then, after 180,000, 190,000 years, why did agriculture all of a sudden happen? But just to get the terminology, the Paleolithic era is that period before agriculture, and then once agriculture starts developing, we are now in the Neolithic era, and some archaeologists will describe a transition period between the Paleolithic and the Neolithic era, called the Mesolithic. And just so you know what these words mean, because they actually make sense when you know what they mean, paleo means old, and lithic means stone, or of stone, so they're really talking about the old stone age. Neolithic, as you can imagine, means new, new stone, so it's kind of the new stone age, and meso means middle, so it is the middle, it is the middle stone age. So another way of thinking about this whole period, from when people were hunter-gatherers all the way to about 11,000 to 7,000 years ago when they developed agriculture, this whole period is called the stone age, and the stone age is kind of this biggest age, and there's just different ways of describing it, because if you just call the stone age, you're really making importance out of the actual tools that people could shape. They weren't able to use metal at this point. When you refer to Paleolithic and Neolithic, you're maybe referring a little bit more, and there's other ways to think about it, but you're referring a little bit more to the lifestyles of the human beings, Paleolithic being hunter-gatherers, Neolithic having actually settled, having actually started to develop kind of primitive villages and even cities, and then, of course, Mesolithic is in between, and just for kind of a pop culture reference, you might have heard of the Paleolithic diet that some people are going on now, and those are people who try to live like hunter-gatherers. Their belief is that most of human evolution occurred while we were hunter-gatherers, and so that's what our bodies are most accustomed to, so they like to eat meat, and they like to eat a lot of nuts, and I even met a co-worker once who used to only eat raw meat, and I don't know if that is even justified or that's even somehow validated by the archaeological record. These people probably did cook their meat. Now, at the end of the Stone Age, we would have, I would say, the number two most significant development in human history, and now we're talking about 3,000 BC, which is about 5,000 years ago, and this is the development of writing. So we were hunter-gatherers about 9,000 to 10,000, 11,000 years ago. People start developing agriculture. It allows them to settle in more dense environments. It also gives them a little bit more free time because they don't have to hunt and gather all the time, and then you go, and once again, we'll probably discover things as we go forward in time that maybe these dates need to be pushed back or whatever else, or we discover new civilizations or who knows, but our best sense is you have these villages, you have these civilizations developing, and by about 5,000 years ago, so this would be 5,000 before the present or 3,000 BC before Christ, you have people saying, hey, why don't we start trying to write down what we know so that when I tell someone orally, it doesn't actually lose information there and so our descendants can slowly collect all of the knowledge we have and maybe accelerate, I don't know if they did it explicitly thinking of these, but let's just write down what we know, and so at about that period of time, you have, as far as we can tell, the first development of kind of a pictogram-based system of writing, and the earliest system of writing we know is cuneiform, which is from the Sumerian civilization, which is now in present-day Iraq, and what's the really big deal about this is that this is, on some level, the beginning of recorded history. We could talk about the word history. You could say that history is all of the past, and we could use the archaeological record to figure out stuff before people started to write things down, but when they started to write things down, now it was recorded. Now we're actually getting actual accounts of what people know, of actual people's knowledge, and the reason why this is a big deal, I mean, agriculture, hopefully you now appreciate that it was a pretty big deal, but the reason why writing was a big deal is that now civilization could collect its knowledge, and it could build upon it generation after generation without having to worry about people forgetting it, or information getting distorted verbally from ancestor to descendant, and with that, you also have the beginning of the Bronze Age, and the Bronze Age is kind of known for this beginning of, even though it's referring to a material, which comes from the first time that people started using bronze as a tool, or using bronze for their tools and for their weapons, and bronze, just you know, it's a mixture of mostly copper and a little bit of tin, but the Bronze Age, at least in my mind, the biggest deal of what started at the beginning of the Bronze Age really, really was the writing. So once again, just as a review, because I actually, I don't know, I find this kind of confusing, our current understanding, most of human prehistory, and even pre-human prehistory, were spent as hunter-gatherers using stone tools until about 11,000 years ago, and then we became a little bit more settled, we became farmers, essentially, using stone tools, and then you fast-forward another about 5,000, 6,000 years, and then we started to become farmers who started to write down the things that we knew, and we started to use bronze tools."
8d9c56d0-0dfe-421c-84fd-dd115a03b318,"Hey, this is Kim from Khan Academy, and today I'm learning about Article Five of the U.S. Constitution, which describes the Constitution's amendment process. To learn more about Article Five, I talked to two experts, Professor Michael Rappaport, who is the Darling Foundation Professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, where he also serves as the Director of the Center for the Study of Constitutional Originalism, and David Strauss, who's the Gerald Ratner Distinguished Service Professor of Law at the University of Chicago Law School, and author of The Living Constitution. Professor Strauss, Article Five provides this process for amending the Constitution. Can you take us through that process a little bit? How does it work? The quick description of the process is it's really hard. It's really hard to amend the Constitution. There are actually a couple of different processes that are laid out in Article Five, but only one has ever been used. Amendment starts in Congress, and two-thirds of each house of Congress, two-thirds of the House of Representatives, and two-thirds of the Senate has to approve the amendment. And then it goes to the states, and three-quarters of the states have to approve the amendment. So you have to have a really strong consensus in order to get the Constitution changed that way. So, Professor Rappaport, take us through this process of amending the Constitution. Why did the framers set it up this way? The framers gave a good bit of thought to coming up with an amendment process, because they recognized that the Constitution might need to be changed over time, either because there were problems with it that weren't anticipated, or because circumstances or values changed. So there are two steps to the amendment process. For an amendment to go into the Constitution, to become part of the Constitution, it has to be both proposed and ratified. On the proposal side, the Congress can propose. Alternatively, a proposal can come from the action of the state legislatures. So two-thirds of the state legislatures say, we'd like to have a constitutional convention propose an amendment. So there's two parts of that, obviously. The state legislatures have got to want it, and then you get a calling of a constitutional convention. Okay, that's the proposal side. There's also the ratification side, which is a little bit simpler. You need three-quarters of the states to ratify a constitutional amendment. And they can ratify it either through the actions of the state legislatures, or the actions of state conventions, which are special bodies which would be elected in order to decide one question, whether or not to ratify that proposed constitutional amendment. This is fascinating. So I actually had no idea about the two-thirds of the state legislatures being able to propose a constitutional amendment. How often does that happen? It has never occurred throughout our history, although a couple of times, there were actions taken to sort of move in that direction. But we've never actually had a constitutional convention that has proposed any amendments. It's important to go into why the framers would have set up the system the way they did. The most usual situation is for the Congress to propose the amendments, and that's happened in all of the 27 amendments, which have been ratified to become part of our Constitution. But what happens if the Congress is the problem? What happens if the Congress is doing, is usurping power, or they're standing in the way of changes that are important, or they need to be reformed? You can't count on the Congress to wanna reform itself. So what they did was to have this alternative mechanism, which would bypass the Congress. And that alternative mechanism was the Constitutional Convention. So the state-led legislatures propose, apply for it. And then the separate entity, the Constitutional Convention, makes a proposal. So they were quite explicit in discussing this, that they wanted this as an alternative to the Congress. So was this on purpose, that they made it very difficult to amend the Constitution? Well, it sure seems like it. Now, of course, we don't know back then what they had in mind, whether they thought, well, the House, the Senate, the states, they'll sort of all be run by the same kind of people, and they'll kind of agree on things. Maybe they thought that, we just don't know. But whatever they were thinking, what they gave us, was a very difficult process to get through. So how long was it from the period when the Constitution was first ratified to the first amendment to the Constitution beyond the Bill of Rights? Okay, so the first 10 amendments were ratified in 1791. And then, just a mere three years later, we had the 11th Amendment. And there was an 11th Amendment in 1798 to correct really kind of a technical problem that the Supreme Court did something that the framers really didn't anticipate it would do, didn't want it to do, and the 11th Amendment was adopted to correct that. The 12th Amendment was adopted in 1804 after the really kind of a disaster in the election of 1800 when there was a tie in the Electoral College. The framers had not foreseen the rise of political parties and political parties made the system for electing the president they had given us very difficult to work with. But then there was nothing, that was 1804, then there was nothing until after the Civil War. And after the Civil War, there were three amendments, then nothing again, really, until the Progressive Era in the early 20th century when there were again a bunch of amendments. And then after then, things had sort of paled off. So we really see these kind of, as I said, these kind of waves in our history. What do you think brings those waves on? Why are there some eras when there are lots of constitutional amendments and other eras when there's nothing? Well, Kim, here I'm gonna say something that I think some people will disagree with, but I think it's right. And that is that I don't think the process of amending the Constitution has really been the way we actually change it. I think what happens is, just because the amendment process is so difficult, we've worked out other ways of changing things. And so amendments come along sometimes because a change has already happened and people decide, well, let's put it in the Constitution just so we can kind of have official recognition of it. But a lot of times changes happen and they're a little bit too controversial to get into the Constitution, but they seem pretty solid and pretty secure. So we just don't, I guess it's fair to say, don't bother to amend the Constitution or don't wanna go through the process of amending the Constitution. Very often people's values may change or they may differ from what's in the Constitution. And it may take a time or circumstances may finally occur that crystallize this desire to change the Constitution. And all of a sudden the opportunity is there and people can suddenly pass a constitutional amendment. It's only gonna occur during certain circumstances, especially when there's strong support for it. Very interesting, yeah. So it's unlikely that we're gonna have a constitutional amendment anytime in the near future. When was the last constitutional amendment? So the simple answer to that was in 1971, we got the 26th amendment that was both proposed and then remarkably, it's all time record, proposed and ratified in three months and eight days. And that was the amendment that guaranteed the right to vote of 18 year old. Ah, right. So sort of as a response to the Vietnam War. Yes, yes. But there actually has been one additional amendment, the 27th amendment, right? So why isn't that the most recent one? Well, here's the funny thing about it. The 27th amendment was proposed as part of the original Bill of Rights in 1789. So this amendment was proposed in 1789, ratified in 1992. So it took 202 years. Interesting, and what's the 27th amendment about? That has to do with congressional salary increases. It basically says if Congress wants to raise its own salary, the increase can't take effect until the next election. So it basically gives the voters a chance to say, hey, we don't like what you did. We're gonna vote you out of office for increasing your salary. So one thing that strikes me about Article V and just the fact that the founders included an amendment process altogether, it seems very humble and farsighted to include a way for the document itself to evolve in a way. Do you think that the framers approached the constitution with the idea that there were things in the future that they just wouldn't be able to anticipate? They had before them and were acutely aware of a history in which efforts to establish governments had failed. And they were really trying to work with that and make sure they didn't do the same thing. So they knew what a hard job they were embarking on. And they made it clear. I mean, there's a famous passage in which James Madison said, look, we know a lot of these provisions that we're writing in the constitution, their meaning is unclear. And their meaning will have to be, his phrase was liquidated, which is to say, people have to figure out what this means because we know what we're giving you is unclear in some ways. So yes, absolutely. They knew there were things that they could not anticipate. The framers themselves weren't in agreement on what freedom of speech means. Some of them enacted, voted for, and got into, enacted laws that restricted speech in ways that we would find intolerable today. We'd say they violate the First Amendment. But here you had some of the guys who drafted the First Amendment voting for those laws. So near the end of Article V, there's this kind of long-winded clause that says, no amendment which may be made prior to the year 1808 shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article. Now, if I'm cross-referencing this correctly, what they're really saying here is, you can't make any amendments about slavery. So why is this here? And why are they talking around it so obliquely? The interesting thing about this is, what did they do? They basically said, for 20 years, there's not gonna be any amendments that are going to speak to the slave trade. And the Constitution is very, let us say, shy about using the term slavery or referring to slavery. It actually never actually refers to the term slave. There's a variety of thoughts about what was going on, but one very common view about this is that the Constitution was sort of a little bit embarrassed that the framers were a little bit embarrassed, or at least some of the framers were embarrassed about it. And so they didn't wanna make reference to it too explicitly. They might've been a little bit worried about what the verdict of history would be. So they knew on some level, the sort of immorality of slavery, but there it is right there in Article V, and there are other places in the Constitution, too, where they don't use the word, but what they're doing is protecting slavery. Now, they did add these amendments to the Constitution about slavery and about, as you say, equal citizenship and voting, but the 14th Amendment providing equal citizenship, that was pretty much nullified in most respects for a large part of our history. States found a way to get around that. The 15th Amendment was also something that was just not very effective in preventing African-Americans from being denied the vote. And yes, there are provisions in the Constitution that are there, and you can invoke them, and you can rely on them, but if you just look at the text of the Constitution, I think you get a misleading impression about how the Constitution in our history has actually worked. Now, this is a very good point, because I think one of the hardest things for students of US history to understand is, how is it possible that after the 14th Amendment was passed, things like Jim Crow happened? And I guess the answer is, the Constitution is only in force if it's enforced. Kim, that's exactly right. It's words on a page. You know, the text is fine, it can say all the right things, but the institutions and the popular will have to be in place to make something of those fine words. Interesting, so how do you think our government might be different if the Constitution didn't include this amendment process? I don't think it would have been that different. Just because Article V gives us such a hard process to go through, just because it's so hard to amend the Constitution, we figured out other ways to change the Constitution in practice, even if the words on the page are the same. And I think if there were no Article V, we would have found a way to get to where we wanted to get to as a country, by those means, by legislation, by presidential action, by Supreme Court decision, and just by the people in their lives saying, you know, we need to go in this direction. We need to go, say, in the direction of women's equality. And by the way, there's no amendment giving women equal rights either, but that's where we've gotten to. And I think that would have been the pattern if there were no formal amendment process. There's a second way in which you could have constitutional change, which is you could simply say, all right, this Constitution was pretty good for a while. It's now outlived its usefulness. Let's have a new Constitution. That would seem like a very radical, big thing to do. No one, virtually no one proposes that at the federal level, but in the states, lots of states have changed their constitutions, not simply passed the constitutional amendment, but just gotten rid of the whole old Constitution and adopted a new one. That's happened many times. And so if we didn't have a constitutional amendment process, it's quite possible that that's exactly what we would have seen at the federal level. Yeah, this is really fascinating because we really think a lot about what the framers intended for certain amendments, for example, freedom of speech, freedom of religion. What did they really mean by those things? But if we had just kind of every now and again said, okay, we're done with that. Let's do a new Constitution. We wouldn't necessarily have that debate. We just say, okay, this is what we meant at the time. Famously, Thomas Jefferson said, it's really not right to have a Constitution that's gonna continue over time and bind future generations. And so we ought to have a new Constitution every 19 years when there's a new generation. And his close friend, James Madison, had to disagree with him and basically said, look, I understand why you're saying that, but you also have to realize the incredible disruption that would cause every 20 years. People wouldn't be able to rely on the existing rights that are in the Constitution because they would know in a certain period of time, new ones would be enacted. We had that debate. Madison won in the sense that the U.S. Constitution is supposed to last for a long-term period. There's no 20-year limit on it. And one of the things that's been beneficial for the United States as a result of that is that we've inherited these constitutional rights that people have a lot of reverence for. So we've learned that there are two ways to amend the Constitution, through Congress or through a special constitutional convention called by the states. Either way, adding an amendment to the Constitution is really difficult to do, so much so that the American people have only in special circumstances used a constitutional amendment to affect social or political change.

9df28010-4692-4b16-8849-36782b392f5c,"In our study of the different types of markets, we are now going to dive a little bit deeper and understand perfect competition. Now this notion of something being perfectly competitive, you might have a general idea of what it means. You might feel like it's very competitive, that there's a lot of people there maybe competing for your business, or maybe there's a lot of buyers and there are a lot of sellers. And that is generally true, but we're trying to be economists here, so we wanna be very precise with our language. So when economists talk about perfect competition, they're talking about this somewhat very abstract state where you have many buyers and sellers, many sellers and buyers. Now that doesn't seem too abstract so far. We can imagine a lot of markets that have many sellers and buyers. Now another thing that defines perfect competition from an economics point of view is that they're selling identical products or services. Products, products or services. Now this one seems a little bit harder because even when you can imagine a fairly competitive market, does everyone sell exactly the same thing? Well you can imagine certain markets, maybe the market for water, or maybe the market for some type of energy, or maybe the market for produce gets pretty close to identical products or services. So so far it doesn't seem like that abstract of a thing. Now another aspect of perfect competition is that every agent, so that would be the buyers, the sellers, the producers, the consumers, they have perfect information. Perfect information. Now what does perfect information mean? It means that every participant in the market, the buyers and the sellers, they all know exactly what is happening in the market. So what goods or services are selling for what price and who is selling to whom? So once again, this gets a little bit more abstract because to get truly perfect information, you can't, not everyone in a market will always know everything that's going on. So once again, this is a little bit of an abstract idea that economists have introduced to be a little bit more precise. And the last aspect we're going to talk about, and this is also something that is a bit idealized, it doesn't truly exist in the real world, things close to this exist in the real world, is that there's no barriers, barriers to entry or exit. Now we already mentioned some markets, say the market for agriculture. That doesn't quite have no barriers to entry or exit. You would somehow have to get land, you would have to get seeds, you would have to get fertilizer, you would have to hire people to put the seeds in and to harvest the crops. And so almost any industry, any market you imagine will have some barriers. But this is an idealized notion that economists like to think about. And of course, in the real world, things might approach this or be closer to perfect competition than say other markets. But when you are in this situation, let's analyze what will be happening. So we can look at the market as a whole for whatever this product and service is. So let me draw price versus quantity here for the market as a whole. So this is price, and this is quantity, and this is the market right over here. And so we've seen this multiple times in our economics journey, that you have an upward sloping supply curve. And once again, this is for the entire market. Let me do this in a different color. So you have an upward sloping supply curve like that. And you would have a downward sloping demand curve like that. And we know what the equilibrium price and quantity would be for the market. So this right over here would be the equilibrium quantity for the market. And this right over here would be the equilibrium price for the market. Now, how would this affect the decisions for the firm in perfect competition? Well, let's draw a similar analysis, but now at the firm level. So on this axis, you could view this for the firm. And so this is going to be the firm right over here, one of the participants in the perfect competition, one of the producers, one of the sellers. So on this axis, you could view this as price. You could also view this as marginal revenue. And you could also view this as marginal cost because we're going to plot different curves here. And then on the horizontal axis, we're going to have quantity again. But this is, once again, the quantity that the firm produces. Now, first of all, we could think about the marginal cost for the firm. And we've seen this multiple times, that the marginal cost for the firm, it might look something like this. It, over time, might trend upwards something like this, where at some point, every incremental unit is costing more and more to produce. Maybe it's harder to get the resources, harder to get the labor, whatever you want to say. So that's the marginal cost curve, fairly typical for a firm. And then we could think about their average total cost. And so the average total cost curve might look something like this. Let's draw it something like this. So our average total cost, we've seen this multiple times. Now, what is going to be the marginal revenue for this firm that is operating in perfect competition? Well, when it's operating in perfect competition, it just has to be a price taker. So every unit it sells, it's just going to get the market price for that unit. So in perfect competition, the firm, every participant that is really identical in a lot of ways, they're just going to take that price. Think about it. They won't be able to charge any more for their product or service than the market price because their product or service is identical to everyone else's, and everyone knows it because of perfect information, and they would have no motivation to charge less either. They're just passive. You could view it that way when it comes to price. So if we just take this market price across, just like that, this right over here, this price is going to define the marginal revenue curve for that firm. So let me make this a bold curve right over here. This is going to be the marginal revenue for the firm. For every unit it sells on the margin, that's how much more revenue it's going to get. Now, you could also view this as the demand curve for the firm's product. You could also view this as the average revenue for the firm's product, and let me make this clear. This is for the firm, demand for the firm, which is equal to the price that the firm actually gets. So the big takeaway here is in perfect competition, which is this somewhat idealized state that doesn't quite exist in the real world. Certain markets can approach it. The firms are passive price takers. They have no say on what the price is going to be, and so it would be rational for them to just produce where their marginal cost intersects with their marginal revenue, because anything more than that, then for every incremental unit, they're going to be spending more money than they get in terms of revenue. And this passivity goes a little bit against some of our everyday notions of fierce competition. When we think about fierce competition, we often think about many players trying to constantly undercut each other, and in future videos, we'll talk about scenarios where that might happen. And you might think about whether or not you would want certain markets to have perfect competition, because no barriers to entry means that, frankly, anybody could get into that industry. So for example, you might not want perfect competition when it comes to someone being, say, your doctor, because you want barriers to entry. You want some level of training. You want some level of experience before someone gets into that service."
f84d9bb8-f0bc-477b-b837-b06c816c9f40,"Hello readers, I'm going to draw you a map right now and it's gonna look like I've drawn a mountain. But it's not a map of a mountain, it's a map of a story. What? You're saying, how do you map a story? What makes a story pointy? These are great questions and to answer them I'll say this, today we're going to talk about the elements of a story or the parts that make it up like ingredients in a recipe. Many stories follow a similar pattern. Good readers know what these patterns are and can talk about them using the right terms. And this helps everyone be on the same page, so to speak, when you discuss or write about the stories you read. I'm about to drop a lot of vocabulary on you so brace yourselves. The story begins with exposition where we learn about the characters and the setting. Then we introduce a conflict or a big problem. As the characters begin to interact with the conflict or try to solve the problem, we enter rising action, this upward slope of the story mountain. When the conflict comes to a head, we hit the most exciting part of the story, the climax. Here, the conflict can't go any further. We're at the top of the mountain. There's nowhere else to go except down. After the climax, after this most exciting part of the story, we enter falling action. The climax will happen much closer to the end of the story than to the middle. It's not a symmetrical mountain. The action slows down, the problem has been solved or maybe the problem has changed and the characters prepare for the last phase of story, the resolution. This is where we tie up loose ends, characters reflect on what they learned, maybe you set up a sequel. Now, look, that was a lot of information all at once. In order to make sense of it, let's apply all of those terms to a story. Now, our go-to has been The Three Little Pigs and while that's a story everyone knows, I'm starting to think it needs to be freshened up a little bit, really work on its franchise potential, you know? So let's go through the elements of story by looking at my new project, a reboot of Three Little Pigs that I'm calling TLP Starbound. See, it's Three Little Pigs, but it's in space. That's a space helmet. So I'm gonna put a little story map here in the corner. Okay, so the exposition, it's the future. Pigs have expanded to every corner of the galaxy. Three brave little pigs decide to strike out on their own, exploring a new, exciting region of space. One builds a spaceship out of straw, go with me here. One builds a spaceship out of twigs. And one builds a spaceship out of a flexible hyper alloy they developed in a laboratory, she's the brainy pig. So we've got the setting, it's the future, they're in space. We've got our characters, the pigs. Now, the conflict. Along comes the notorious space pirate, Captain Wolf. He's big, he's bad. He wants to blow up the spaceships and eat the pigs. He begins hunting down the pig ships one at a time. See, Captain Wolf has an eye patch. No, he has a cyber eye. He's part robot. And now we enter our rising action phase. Captain Wolf engages the straw ship. They have an exciting space battle. Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew. And straw pig escapes in a little escape pod to the twig ship. But Captain Wolf follows, he is undaunted. The tension continues to rise. He destroys the twig ship. Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew. The two pigs escape again, this time to the brick house. I mean, the flexible hyper alloy spaceship piloted by the science pig. And now we come to the climax. Captain Wolf comes to the advanced ship. He tries to blow it up, but he can't, it's too powerful. He decides to board the ship because that's the only way he'll get to eat the pigs. But the pigs trap him in a space barrel while he's still in the airlock. They did it. They solved the problem. Captain Wolf is trapped in a space barrel and he can't eat them now. The climax is past. And now we enter the falling action phase of the story. In the version of the story that I know, the three little pigs roll the barrel into the river. So I think maybe in this version, they punt the space barrel out the airlock into the cold void of space. Or maybe they strand him on a deserted planet. But in any case, they never have to deal with the wolf again. The threat is now gone. And that means that the conflict has been resolved. We're in the resolution part of the story now. The first two little pigs, the straw ship pig and the twig ship pig, learn that they need to put more work into their spaceships if they wanna survive in space. And they build fancy spaceships just like the science pig. And that's an introduction to story elements. Now that you're familiar with the ideas, start applying them to your favorite stories. You can do this with any form of media, books, comics, TV shows, movies, games. What's the conflict? How is it resolved? Once you start looking for story structure in entertainment, you will find it everywhere. Let us know what you see. You can learn anything. David out."
9bb03f8a-5fd2-4559-b4fd-c55fffa80ec5,"Hey, this is Kim from Khan Academy, and today I'm learning about Article Four of the U.S. Constitution. Article Four lays out the nuts and bolts of how federalism, the system of shared governance between states and the federal government, works in practice. Article Four has four sections. The first two, the Full Faith and Credit Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause, talk about how states will treat each other's citizens as well as they treat the citizens of their own states. Then the third section is an Admissions Clause, discussing how new states will be added to the union. And the fourth section is the Guarantee Clause, which guarantees every state in the union a Republican form of government. To learn more about Article Four, I sought out the help of two experts. Erin Hawley is an Associate Professor of Law at the University of Missouri. Her scholarship focuses on the federal courts, and she teaches constitutional litigation, tax policy, and agricultural law. Professor Gabriel Chin is the Director of Clinical Legal Education at the UC Davis School of Law. He's a teacher and scholar of immigration law, criminal procedure, and race and law. So Professor Hawley, can you take us a little bit through why the Framers included Article Four? What was its purpose? The founders of the Constitution were very concerned that the federal government be one of limited powers. And because of that, they saw the states as having an active and critical role in placing a check on the federal government. So we've got the three branches and their own checks and balances, and then we've got the federal government and the state government also playing a role in checking and balancing each other. They wanted to establish a strong central government, but also to ensure that it didn't have too much power, and the states were critical to this effort. Also, they very much wanted the states to act collectively, not individually. As you'll recall, the states had not been doing so well under the loose Articles of Confederation. They'd sort of been going it alone on critical issues like trade and defense as to the detriment of the union. So Article Four is also sort of key to making sure that the states act sort of as a unified whole rather than going it alone. It's one country made up of diverse states. And if you prefer the way things are done in Nevada, you can move there. And if you think that some other state has a better set of answers to the problems of modern life, you can move. What the Full Faith and Credit Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause are designed to do is to facilitate transactions, to facilitate moving, to facilitate communications and commerce and trade and travel among the states. But that doesn't mean that what's going on in each of the states can't be very, very different. We often think of checks and balances as being something that was designed to be kind of horizontal, that the legislature and the executive branch and the judicial branch kind of all at the same level checking each other. But there's also kind of this vertical checks and balances happening too, between the power of the federal government, power of the states and the power of the local governments. Absolutely. So we've got the three branches and their checks and balances, but we also have a strong central government that's checked in large part by strong independent sovereign governments in each of the 50 states. And these states traditionally have what are known as police powers. So they have a lot of inherent authority to govern the people in those states, subject to federal law. But it really does sort of place a check on federal authority. And I think this is precisely what the framers wanted because they did want a strong government, but they also were very much of the view that states were important, that their own states were important and they didn't want to lose that in the new constitution and new federal government. There are four sections in article four. And the first section deals with full faith and credit. It says full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of every other state. So what does full faith and credit actually mean? It's designed to make in a certain sense, all of the states of the United States part of a single system. And so full faith and credit means that a court judgment, for example, in one state will be recognized in every state. So if you have a valid judgment in New York, for example, and you move to California, the California courts are required to give effect to that judgment, to that state court judgment, so long as it was validly issued. There was a federal statute known as the Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA that was passed under President Clinton. And recently the Supreme Court struck that down as unconstitutional. So now under full faith and credit, if you're married in one state, you're married in another state as well. You can see the kinds of problems that would exist if states didn't honor the legal decisions that were made by other states, such as who's married or who's divorced, or who owns a particular piece of property, or whether a particular child is going to be in the custody of one parent rather than another. And the full faith and credit clause is designed to say, in order for our system to work as a unified whole, while it's true that the courts of Georgia are distinct from the courts of New York, et cetera, they're separate systems, but they have to treat the work that each other does with respect. If we move on to section two, this says that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states. So what are these privileges and immunities? So the privileges and immunities clause has been one that's subject to a number of sort of debate in the courts, in the academic literature, but basically privileges and immunities have been construed to be those sorts of things that would go with citizenship. So the right to travel, for example, is a privilege and immunity, those sorts of things. Occasionally in American history, there have been moments where states didn't wanna let citizens of other states come through. So during the depression, there was an effort by some states to limit the migration of people from out-of-state to in-state. And the Supreme Court said, that's not permissible. It also protects the right to travel. In 1999, the Supreme Court dealt with a case called Sines versus Roe. And what that case was about is that California had relatively generous welfare benefits, and California wanted to set up its law in such a way that it wouldn't encourage people from other states to move to California just to get the welfare benefits. And so what they did is they said that if you don't live in California, if you're moving from out-of-state and you apply for welfare benefits, then we're gonna give you the welfare benefits that you would have gotten in your state for the first year. We're not gonna give you the higher California benefits. We're gonna give you whatever you would have gotten where you came from. That's unconstitutional. And the Supreme Court said that violates the privileges and immunities clause where one country, one nation, people are allowed to cross the borders whenever they want. Interesting, but there's this second part of it that says no person held to service or labor in one state under the laws thereof, escaping into another shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from service or labor. So what is that all about? So that is one of the most unfortunate, probably the most unfortunate clauses in our Constitution. It's known as the Fugitive Slave Clause. And that title is pretty descriptive. So if you have a slave who is validly owned, as it were in those days, under one state's law, and that person escaped to a free state, this clause gave the owner the right to reclaim that slave and put them back into sort of ownership in their own state. It is a sneaky way of talking about slavery. And this compromise with slavery was necessary to create the United States. Slavery, the word, isn't used in the Constitution. They only use these euphemisms, these sort of complicated circumlocutions. And there's an argument that there's a reason for that. And the reason for that is that a lot of the framers of the Constitution didn't support slavery, opposed slavery. They did think that it was important to have a United States and to have a Constitution. So they wanted to do what was necessary to achieve that, but they did the absolute minimum. And they did it in such a way that consciously doesn't recognize and legitimize the institution of slavery. All right, so then we get into new states and territories. So I think it was very forward-looking of the framers to recognize that new states might wanna join the Union and then to provide a process for that. So can you tell us a little bit about what that process was like? So Article 4, Section 3, Clause 1 provides the process for admitting new states. Again, it recognizes that new states might want to join the Union. And it gives a wide latitude to Congress for admitting new states. So basically the process was that a territory would indicate to the Congress that it wished to become a state. Then they would submit a Constitution and Congress would approve the new state. But the Constitution itself in Article 4 places some limitations on that. Some of the Eastern states were concerned that the large Western territories might become too influential. So they had a couple of provisions that no new state could be created out of an old state, nor could parts of states be combined to form a new state unless there was consent from all of the involved states. And it's not so clear that purchase of territory from foreign governments was a power that was granted in the Constitution to anyone. Thomas Jefferson, who was the president at the time of the Louisiana Purchase, had doubts that the Louisiana Purchase was constitutional. He thought that it was a great idea to purchase all that land from France, but he thought that it would require a constitutional amendment for the United States to have that power. This is different from Texas joining the Union. But the House and the Senate didn't have the same qualms that President Jefferson did. And so they agreed to approve the Louisiana Purchase and to fund it. When the bill got to Thomas Jefferson's desk, he signed it. Moving on to Section 4, there's this promise here that the federal government will guarantee every state a Republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion or domestic violence. What does this mean? So we see here in Article 4, the end of Article 4, a really sort of famous and important promise to each of the individual states. The federal government is promising to basically aid them in keeping a Republican form of government. As we'll remember, Benjamin Franklin famously said, we've given you a republic if you can keep it. So when we talk about invasion, when Section 4 talks about invasion, it's pretty clear that what they're talking about is invasion by some hostile state. And of course, during this period, there was continuing conflict with England. And the idea is that if New York or South Carolina gets invaded by England, that's not just that particular state's problem, it's the nation's problem. And the national government has an obligation to protect against invasion. And I imagine it also prevents someone from, for example, declaring themselves the King of Maryland. The Republican form of government clause does that. It leaves the details to the states. But the basic idea is that the concept of Republican government that's embodied in Article 4 is majority rule. That even if there were free and fair elections, the state could not choose to have military or hereditary government. So even if everybody in California got together and said, you know, what we really need is a good family that generation after generation will lead us, and they will be the kings and queens of California. And this is what we want. And so we're going to amend our constitution to provide for hereditary leadership in our state. And we're gonna find somebody great, and this is what we wanna do. Article 4 would say we can't choose to do that even through democratic means. So as we've learned, Article 4 requires states to give full faith and credit to the legal proceedings of other states and to treat the citizens of other states as well as they treat their own citizens. It provides a process for adding new states into the mix and guarantees a Republican form of government to the citizens of all the states. Article 4 binds the United States together. So it's not just a collection of independent states, but rather a unified nation.

44de222a-b616-47b6-9c04-e30a73a3ab88,"We know that an element is defined by the number of protons it has. For example, potassium, we look at the periodic table of elements, and I have a snapshot of not the entire table, but part of it here. Potassium has 19 protons, and we could write it like this. And this is a little bit redundant. We know that if it's potassium, that atom has 19 protons, and we know if an atom has 19 protons, it is going to be potassium. Now, we also know that not all members of, or not all of the atoms of a given element have the same number of neutrons. And when we talk about a given element, but we have different numbers of neutrons, we call them isotopes of that element. So, for example, potassium can come in a form that has exactly 20 neutrons, and we call that potassium 39. And the 39, this mass number, it's a count of the 19 protons plus 20 neutrons. And this is actually the most common isotope of potassium. It accounts for 93.3. I'm just rounding off. This is 93.3% of the potassium that you would find on Earth. Now, some of the other isotopes of potassium, you also have potassium, and once again, writing the K and the 19 are a little bit redundant. You also have potassium 41, so this would have 22 neutrons. 22 plus 19 is 41. This accounts for about 6.7% of the potassium on the planet. And then you have a very scarce isotope of potassium called potassium 40. Potassium 40 currently has 21 neutrons, and it's very, very, very, very scarce. It accounts for only 0.0117% of all the potassium. But this is also the isotope of potassium that's interesting to us from the point of view of dating old, old rock, and especially old volcanic rock. And as we'll see, when you can date old volcanic rock, it allows you to date other types of rock or other types of fossils that might be sandwiched in between old volcanic rock. And so what's really interesting about potassium 40 here is that it has a half-life of 1.25 billion years. So the good thing about that, as opposed to something like carbon-14, it can be used to date really, really, really old things. And every 1.25 billion years, that's its half-life, so 50% of any given sample will have decayed, and 11% will have decayed into argon-40. So argon is right over here. It has 18 protons. So when you think about it decaying into argon-40, what you see is that it lost a proton, but it has the same mass number. So one of the protons must have somehow turned into a neutron. It actually captures one of the inner electrons, and then emits other things, and I won't go into all the quantum physics of it, but it turns into argon-40, and 89% turn into calcium-40. And you see calcium on the periodic table right over here is 20 protons. So this is a situation where one of the neutrons turns into a proton. This is a situation where one of the protons turns into a neutron. And what's really interesting to us is this part right over here. Because what's cool about argon, and we studied this a little bit in the chemistry playlist, it is a noble gas. It is unreactive. And so when it is embedded in something that's in a liquid state, it'll kind of just bubble out. It's not bonded to anything, and so it'll just bubble out and just go out into the atmosphere. So what's interesting about this whole situation is you can imagine what happens during a volcanic eruption. Let me draw a volcano here. So let's say that this is our volcano, and it erupts at some time in the past. So it erupts, and you have all of this lava flowing. All of this lava. And while the lava, that lava will contain some amount of potassium-40, and actually it'll already contain some amount of argon-40. It'll already contain some amount of argon-40. But what's neat about argon-40 is that while it's lava, while it's in this liquid state, so let's imagine this lava right over here. It's a bunch of stuff. It's a bunch of stuff right over here. But in that stuff, it is going to have, I'll do the potassium-40 in, let me do it in a color that I haven't used yet. I'll do the potassium-40 in magenta. It'll have some potassium-40 in it. I'm maybe overdoing it. It's a very scarce isotope. But it'll have some potassium-40 in it, and it might already have some argon-40 in it. So it might already have some argon-40 in it, just like that. But argon-40 is a noble gas. It's not going to bond to anything. And while this lava is in a liquid state, it's going to be able to bubble out. It's going to be able to bubble out. It'll just float to the top. It has no bonds. And it'll just evaporate, or I should say evaporate. It'll just bubble out, essentially, because it's not bonded to anything. And so it'll just seep out while we are in a liquid state. And what's really interesting about that is that when you have these volcanic eruptions, and because this argon-40 is seeping out, by the time this lava has hardened into volcanic rock, and I'll do that, let me do that volcanic rock in a different color, by the time it has hardened into volcanic rock, all of the argon-40 will be gone. It won't be there anymore. And so what's neat is this volcanic event, the fact that this rock has become liquid, it kind of resets the amount of argon-40 there. So then you're only going to be left with potassium-40 here. You're going to be left with potassium-40. And that's why the argon-40 is more interesting, because the calcium-40 won't necessarily have seeped out. And there might have already been calcium-40 here, so it won't necessarily seep out. But the argon-40 will seep out, so it kind of resets it. The volcanic event resets the amount of argon-40. So at future date, so right when the event happened, you shouldn't have any argon-40, right when that lava actually becomes solid. And so if you fast-forward to some future date, and if you look at the sample, let me copy and paste it. So let me copy and let me paste it. So if you fast-forward to some future date, if you fast-forward to some future date, and you see that there is some argon-40 there, you see that there is some argon-40 in that sample, you know this is volcanic rock. You know that it was due to some previous volcanic event. You know that this argon-40 is from decayed potassium-40. It's from decayed potassium-40. And you know that it has decayed since that volcanic event, because if it was there before, it would have seeped out. So the only way that this would have been able to get trapped is if, while it was liquid, it would seep out, but once it's solid, it can get trapped inside the rock. And so you know that the only way this argon-40 can exist there is by decay from that potassium-40. So you can look at the ratio. So you know for every one of these argon-40s, you know for every one of these argon-40s, because it's only 11% of the decay products are argon-40, for every one of those, you must have on the order of about 9 calcium-40s that also decayed. And so for every one of these argon-40s, you know that there must have been 10 original potassium-40s. And so what you can do is you can look at the ratio of the number of potassium-40s there are today to the number that there must have been, based on this evidence right over here, to actually date it. And in the next video, I'll actually go through the mathematical calculation to show you that you can actually date it. And the reason this is really useful is you can look at those ratios, and volcanic eruptions aren't happening every day, but if you start looking over millions and millions of years, on that timescale, they're actually happening reasonably frequent. And so if you dig in the ground, and so let's dig in the ground. So let's say this is the ground right over here, and you dig enough, and you see a volcanic eruption. You see some volcanic rock right over there, and then you dig even more. There's another layer of volcanic rock right over there. So this is another layer of volcanic rock. And let's say that this one over here, so they're all going to have a certain amount of potassium-40 in it. This is going to have some amount of potassium-40 in it. And then let's say this one over here has more argon-40. This one has a little bit less. And using the math that we're going to do in the next video, let's say you're able to say that this is, using the half-life, and using the ratio of argon-40 that's left, or using the ratio of the potassium-40 left to what you know was there before, you say that this must have solidified 100 million years ago, 100 million years before the present. And you know that this layer right over here solidified. Let's say you know it solidified 150 million years before the present. And let's say you feel pretty good that this soil hasn't been dug up and mixed or anything like that. It looks like it's been pretty untouched when you look at these soil samples right over here. And let's say you see some fossils in here. Then, even though carbon-14 dating is kind of useless, really when you get beyond 50,000 years, you see these fossils in between these two periods. It's a pretty good indicator, if you can assume that this soil hasn't been dug around and mixed, that this fossil is between 100 million and 150 million years old. This event happened. Then you have these fossils got deposited. These animals died, or they lived and they died. And then you had this other volcanic event. So it allows you, even though you're only directly dating the volcanic rock, it allows you, when you look at the layers, it allows you to relatively date things in between those layers. So it isn't just about dating volcanic rock. It allows us to date things that are very, very, very old and go way further back in time than just carbon-14 dating."
710bc4c1-b6c1-4ecb-b677-180d7804aa05,"For us modern humans with our easy access to the local supermarket, it's easy to forget that throughout human history, and even today, the amount of humans or the human population has been limited by our ability to get calories or get human consumable food from the land. So what I want to do in this video is give us a little bit of a framework for thinking about how humans have been gathering calories from the land and how that's placed an upper limit on the number of humans that can live in any given area or the population density of humans. So right over here, you have some gentlemen looking for food. They are hunter-gatherers. I'll say HG for short. And the H part, the hunter part, they might actually find some animals. I think these guys right over here are trying to trap some rabbits. And the gathering part, they're just literally looking for food. Maybe they find fruit of some sort or some nuts or maybe some roots that are edible by humans. So literally, they just walk around, either try to kill things or find things that they can consume. So I'll call this right over here stage one. Actually, let me write it over here. So this is hunter-gatherers. And this is what most humans have done through most of human history. And just to give us a little bit of a framework for maybe how much they could get from the land, and I looked at some of our best sense of studying hunter-gatherer populations. In land like this, maybe they can get about 200 calories. And I'll make this whole column right over here. This whole column right over here is the amount that they could get in terms of calories per square kilometer per day. Now, it's obviously going to be hugely dependent on the number of animals that are there, the type of land that's there. If they're next to a stream where maybe fish are just jumping out of the stream, this number would be much higher. If they were in some type of a desert, this number would be much lower. But this is actually fairly in line with some of the studies of hunter-gatherer cultures. Now, if this is the number of calories that they can get from each square kilometer per day, how many humans can live in a square kilometer per day? Or what is the density of humans? Well, to figure that out, we have to know on average how many calories does a human need to survive. And for the sake of this video, I'm going to make the assumption that a human being needs 2,000 calories per day to survive in a non-malnourished state. And obviously, it's hugely dependent on how active this person is or how large they are. And one other note, in this whole video, I'm going to be using calories with a capital C. And the calories with a capital C are the calories that people are used to referring to when you go to the gym and you run on the treadmill and it says how many calories you've burned or you look at the back of your candy bar and it says 200 calories. These are the calories I'm talking about. They are a slightly different notion than the calories that you encounter in chemistry class. Those calories are calorie with a lowercase c. And just so that you can be optimally confused, it turns out that one calorie with an uppercase C is equal to 1,000, 1,000 calories with a lowercase c. 1,000 calories. And the lowercase c calories is the amount of energy needed to heat one gram of water one degrees Celsius. And so this is what you see in your chemistry class, but this is not what we're going to be talking about in this video. We're talking about the capital C, the calories that dietitians are always talking about. So with this assumption that the average human needs 2,000 calories a day to not get malnourished, and obviously men would need more, women would need less, children would need even less, but with this assumption, what is the density of humans that could be supported by this culture right over here? Well, 200 calories is 1 10th of the average daily human requirement if you believe this assumption. So the population density, so the density in, let me write it, humans per square kilometer, you can only support 1 10th of a human with this calorie output. So you can only support 1 10th of a human per square kilometer. So one human would actually need 10 square kilometers of hunter-gatherer, to hunt from and gather from in order to support just themselves. They would need maybe 30 or 40 square kilometers to support an entire family so that they could wander around and kill the animals and find whatever they need to find on that land. Now let's go to kind of, you can view it as maybe the next stage, although it's not always the case that herding is going to be more productive than hunter-gatherers, especially in the case where the fish are jumping out of the water. But let's go to this scenario right over here. So this is, we can call this a pastoral lifestyle. So this is two, I'll call it pastoral. And over here is the realization that, look, you have all of this vegetation that maybe humans can't consume, but there are other animals that can consume this vegetation, and they can turn those calories into calories that can be consumed by a human, and namely, the calories are themselves. So this gentleman right over here, after he gets these sheep to be nice and fat, he can either eat the sheep or he can drink their milk. So one way to think about it is these cattle or these sheep right over here, by herding them and letting them eat the grass, he's turning non-human consumable calories into human consumable calories. And so for the sake of our thought experiment, let's say we get a 10 times increase in the human consumable calories per square kilometer. So now instead of 200, we're up to 2,000. And so instead of one human per square kilometer, we have enough calories per square kilometer per day to support one human. So instead of 0.1, we can now support one human. So in that 10 square kilometers, we can now support 10 people. In 100 square kilometers, we could now support 100 people. Now, the next stage, and I'm skipping a bunch of stages because you have things like subsistence agriculture and various forms, and they're not going to be equally productive, and it depends what the land is like, and it depends what the tools are at your disposal. But the next stage that I'll just kind of jump to, we can call traditional agriculture. So this right over here, let's call that traditional agriculture. And that's this one over here as well. So both of these, I'm gonna call traditional agriculture. And for the purposes of this video, the difference between traditional agriculture and modern agriculture, in traditional agriculture, you didn't have mechanization, so you didn't, or very primitive mechanization. You definitely did not have fossil fuel-based engines. You didn't have modern pesticides. You did not have modern genetically engineered crops. But you did have some of the basic science of breeding crops and irrigating and using animals as tools. So in this stage right over here, and once again, it completely depends on where you are on the planet, how fertile the land is, how good your tools are, what crops you're actually producing. Let's assume that we got a hundredfold increase in productivity. And looking at some of the historical records, it looks like, depending on, once again, where you are, that's not out of the realm of possibility. So you have a hundredfold increase. So instead of 2,000 calories per square kilometer per day, you can get 200,000. 200,000 calories per square kilometer per day. And now you could support 100 humans per square kilometer, if you wanted to. So you might not have a hundred humans. One, not all the land you might be able to farm from. Or there are other limits on the population for whatever they might be. But the important thing to think about this upper bound, in this traditional, if you are able to get this type of productivity from your land, and you're able to, in theory, support a hundred people per square kilometer, that means if all of a sudden you have 200 people living there, maybe everyone's migrated to this land because it seems especially fertile, or all the really smart farmers live there, then all of a sudden, not everyone's going to be able to get 2,000 calories a day. Some people might get malnourished. Other people might actually starve. There's this upper bound on the actual number of people that can be there, based on how productive the land actually is. And now let's move over to modern agriculture. And we've already talked a little bit about what exactly is modern agriculture. You have machines like this combine over here that does a lot of the human labor. One human can, and I'll talk about the different dimensions because there's actually two dimensions here. How much calories can you get from the land? And how much energy can one human, how much labor can one human input into the land using tools at their disposal? So in this case, cattle, these ox pulling this plow, or in this case, this combine that's fueled by fossil fuels. But in modern agriculture, because of all of the things, you have these amazing tools, you have genetically engineered crops, you have modern pesticides, and not everyone is a fan of all of these things, but they have hugely increased our productivity. So you have modern agriculture. And let's say that you get another factor of 10 from traditional agriculture. So now you can get 2 million calories per square kilometer per day, or you can support 1,000, you can support 1,000 humans, 1,000 humans per square kilometers. And once again, this right over here, this right over here is an upper bound. And just to give a sense, and I picked these numbers just so that the numbers would be clean. I looked at some historical records. These aren't completely out of line with what it looks like humans have been able to do in the past. But to give you a sense of what human population densities look like right now, and why this upper bound seems to be right about correct, in a place like the United States, so in the United States, the population density is 30 people per square kilometer. So this is 30 humans per square kilometer. In a more dense country, or significantly more dense country like India, the population density is 300 humans per square kilometer. And in the most population dense country in the world, which is where I come from, or actually I was born in New Orleans, where some of my ancestors came from, which is Bangladesh. So there's a lot of people like me, I guess. In Bangladesh, you have a population density of 900 humans per square kilometer. And to some degree, this is a testament to the fertility of the land and whatever else. But this is pretty near the limits, depending on agricultural productivity and whatnot in the land, of modern technology. So it really makes you think, if you don't get population under control, you might end up with some of these kind of hitting the wall type of scenarios. And so the last thing I want you to think about, and this is what I refer to a little bit more, is just think about those two dimensions, because sometimes they get a little bit muddled. One is the kind of the productivity of land, productivity of land. And then the other is the productivity of labor, productivity of labor. So right over here in a hunter-gatherer, they're not getting money calories from their land, so they're right over there. And the humans have to do all the labor. They don't have animals helping them in any way. They definitely don't have robots or any type of engines helping them in any way. And so they have to spend a lot of human time and a lot of human labor doing the work, getting that productivity from the land. But as we progress, so as we progress with things that aid humans, so for example, if all of a sudden you have cattle helping you or you have other tools that help you, you get more human productivity. So less and less of human labor has to be used to get that productivity of the land. And so maybe other humans can go do other things like paint pictures or become blacksmiths or whatever. And in this direction, you get higher productivity per unit of land. And so that comes from moving from hunter-gatherer to a pastoral lifestyle, to traditional farming with irrigation, to modern farming. And so on this graph right over here, kind of tools for the individuals move us up, getting more productivity of the land move us to the right. Modern agriculture gets us right over here. So we're getting much, much more calories per unit land and we're getting much, much more calories per unit labor. So you need a much smaller percentage of the human population actually involved in the farming. Anyway, I'll let you go there. Hopefully that gives you at least an understanding that food doesn't just come from nowhere and it really is a rate-limiting factor on humanity's population."
78ebc5c3-0327-49c3-8575-20f98dee2583,"There are many things that differentiate human beings from other species. But the one thing that probably differentiates humans, even from our closest relatives in the animal kingdom, in a really big way is the notion that humans are collective learners. And to understand that, let's think about how even our closest relative in the animal kingdom, the chimpanzee, might communicate. So you might have one chimpanzee. And over the course of his or her lifetime, they are able to learn a bunch of cool experiences. And they're even able to learn to use tools, manipulate tools, and who knows, maybe even make tools. Maybe even get a twig someplace and take off the leaves and then use that to go get ants out of a hole or whatever else. So they're able to learn all of this stuff over a lifetime. Now, unfortunate for chimpanzees, well, what is fortunate for chimpanzees is they do teach some of these things that they've learned to other members of their group, often their offspring. But what's unfortunate for chimpanzees is they don't have a great way to communicate with each other. So for most chimpanzees, the way that they're able to teach is essentially by kind of showing, not showing and telling, just showing. And so because this is such an imprecise or not exact and such an inefficient way of communication, they're really all of the nuances of what this chimpanzee might be able to accumulate over his or her lifetime aren't able to be conveyed to the next generation or to the other chimpanzees around. So you have tremendous energy loss. And in particular, all that can be conveyed are maybe the specific movements or what you might be able to kind of observe in the present. All of the other things that maybe the chimpanzee is learning about the times of year where this is appropriate. And maybe they can convey some of that by showing them at the right times of year. But other nuanced aspects of it or particular ways to hold something or twist something can only be shown. It can't be described in a very precise way. So you have all of this loss of experience, this loss of information. And then over the course of these animals' life, they may be able to learn the same amount again. They're able to learn maybe the same amount again. But then when they need to communicate it, they have the exact same problem. It's hard to communicate it with what they have at their disposal, which is really just showing the other chimpanzees what they've done. And so once again, you have a loss of information. And what you have in this type of circumstance is generation after generation, even though there is learning over the course of an individual chimpanzee's life, and even though they can communicate some of that to each other, that form of communication loses so much information and so much nuance that you never have an overall accumulation of knowledge and wisdom in this chimpanzee population. Now, humans, on the other hand, have something called symbolic language. And I'll talk about this in a second. But for now, it's safe to say that human language is far more precise and far more efficient than just being able to show someone something. Imagine if you had to learn how to do something without being able to communicate verbally, if you just had to look at someone else's actions. And then you'd have a good idea of how difficult it is for chimpanzees to teach each other. But in the case of human beings, we have this thing called symbolic language that's a very precise, a very efficient way of communicating. So from one human being to another, you can actually communicate a good deal, maybe not every single nuance and every single experience, but a good chunk of it. So right here, I'm drawing about that much of it to some other human being. Maybe it is the offspring. Maybe it is another member of the tribe or the group or whatever it is. And then this human being might come up with some other innovations. They're able to build off of all of this learning from that previous generation or from that other human being that's around. And they're able to come up with their own nuances and their own innovations. And this one right over here might come up with his or her own nuances and innovations. And because they have a good communication mechanism, this one could even communicate to that one what he's learned or what she's learned and communicate a good chunk of that. Maybe not all of it, but maybe a reasonable bit. They can describe exactly how they do something, the times of years, when it's good to do it, when it's not good to do it, how to plan for the future, what's the history of this new learning. And so what you have going on here is because of this strong communication mechanism, so strong, precise, efficient communication, what you have is a human group, or eventually a human civilization, is able to have a collective memory. In the case of the chimpanzees, every generation, every chimpanzee is having to relearn the things that the other chimpanzees might have already done in previous generations. They're not able to really move forward or build on those in significant ways. In humans, as information is learned and experience gained, a good bit of that is able to be passed on to other humans. And so this might be passed on. So all of this might be passed on, or a good chunk of this could be passed on to the next generation. And I'm not even talking about written language yet. This could still just be oral communication, which is still a very strong, precise, efficient means of communication. Written communication takes it to another level. But then this person over here, maybe she comes up with other innovations. And at some point, you might say, well, look, if everyone keeps having innovations and they keep learning what everyone learned in previous generations, maybe this will tap out the total amount of memory that a human being even has. And there's actually a case that maybe this is one of the reasons why humans even have larger memories. Because there is all of this collective knowledge to gain from one generation to another, from one human being to another. But there are some limits to this. And this is the other element where this collective aspect of collective memory and collective learning becomes really powerful. A human being, because of the strong communication mechanism, is not just limited to the knowledge and the experience in their memory. They are able to tap into. So this human being right over here does not have this skill set. And that skill set maybe gets passed on to another human being. So let me copy and paste that. So let's say you copy and let's say you paste that. This other human being that's maybe living at the same time. And when that becomes relevant, they could actually tap into it. And maybe they could learn it from that human being. Or maybe it's in a different part of society. And this human being can build certain tools or build certain things using this information, using that knowledge right over there. And then this human being doesn't need to know that information. They can just leverage the output of that information to then build on top of it. So what it allows human beings to do is not only convey information and build on information from generation to generation, human to human, it allows all of the human brains collectively at any given point of time to be one collective memory bank that can be used to develop or innovate in specific domains and adapt to specific parts of the ecosystem or to teach each other. So all of a sudden, this is really unique, as far as we can tell, in the animal kingdom. All of a sudden, it's not all about the brain or the memory of one individual member of a species. It now becomes about the brain or the memory of the entire civilization or the entire group of the species. And just as an example of that, there's, as far as I know, there's no human being who knows how to do everything that all human beings know how to do. I could imagine that there is a chimpanzee that knows how to do everything that any other chimpanzee knows how to do. There are no humans that can be a fighter pilot, a doctor, a gymnast, a lawyer, understands philosophy, speaks 20 different languages. As far as I know, that human being does not exist. And that's OK, because they can tap into the experiences, the abilities of other human beings to build up their civilization. None of us, as far as we know, knows how to do everything that we need to actually build our civilization. But the information is in our collective memory to actually do it. Now, the next thing you might say is, OK, I started with this premise that we have a strong, precise, efficient means of communication and that other animals don't. But don't other animals actually have some form of language? So for example, even monkeys, when they screech, when they are in danger, that's a form of communication, maybe a form of language. Maybe certain animals, birds, monkeys, maybe they have a song that they sing that can convey certain things. Maybe it's when they are looking for a mate. Isn't that a form of communication? And these are. These are a form of communication and a form of language. But these don't really come in play in terms of the teaching learning. You don't see one chimpanzee making screeching sounds or learning sounds. They might do a little bit just to warn, maybe as a warning. But there's no deep nuance or deep precision that's being able to convey by these one-off sounds or even one-off gestures. And what's particularly powerful about human language is that it is a symbolic language. And when I say it's a symbolic language, I'm even saying it in a broader sense than even just written symbols. I'm talking about even the sounds themselves. So let's go to a time where we did not even have writings. And when we talk about symbolic languages, let's think about a non-symbolic language. So in a non-symbolic language, you might have some sound. Let's call it sound one. And it has some meaning. Let's call it meaning one. So this might be a certain type of scream. It means that a predator is approaching. Then you might have something like a sound two or gesture two. And then it has some other meaning. It has meaning two. It might be a certain type of song, which means that I am in the mood to reproduce or whatever else. You might have gesture three that has some direct meaning. It might mean that I have found food or something like that. So meaning three. What humans have, they can do this, where particular sounds have particular meanings. For example, in humans, you could have sound one. It refers to meaning one. I'll just refer it to meaning one. You could have sound two that refers to meaning two. You could have sound three that refers to meaning three. So these are just direct representations. But what is really powerful about symbolic languages is that these oral symbols can be combined according to set rules or grammars to have an infinite number of meanings. So this is what really makes human language transcend other languages and really makes it this robust, precise communication mechanism, is you could have combinations. Sound one, sound two, sound three will now have another meaning, meaning four. Then you could maybe have a combination where you have sound three, sound one, and sound two might have meaning five. And if you have tens of thousands of sounds, when really our oral words are those sounds in a given language, then all of a sudden, you can have infinite meanings by putting them in different combinations. And if you think this is a little bit abstract, imagine that sound one is the sound me saying the word dog. And I'm not even going to write it down because I want to imagine a world even before written communication. So sound one is the sound dog. Sound two is the sound eats. And sound three is the sound man. So literally, sound one, if you heard dog, you'd think, OK, I'd visualize a dog of some type. And even there, you'd have some visualization of a dog. And we all have one, maybe. Sound two, if you heard eats, you'd say, OK, I imagine eating in some way. And sound three, man, you have some visualization of it. And if it was a non-symbolic language, that's all you could get out of those three sounds. But now in a symbolic language, we can combine those. We could say dog eats man. So once again, we just reused the three sounds, the three symbols. But now they're referring to a whole new, much more complex meaning than just referring to certain objects or certain actions. Or you could have man eats dog. It's not pleasant, but I guess in a desperate situation. But once again, it is another meaning that we can get out of the same sounds. And what these symbolic languages do, besides giving you an infinite number of meanings, they're allowed to give you more nuance and really refer to things that are abstract, including, and maybe most importantly, things like the present, the future, the past, kind of hypothetical things that really are necessary in order to really communicate or optimally communicate all of the experiences or the learnings from one entity to another."
6986bbc2-6223-4138-a7d4-60fa069310ab,"Now that we've figured out the total revenue given any quantity, and we've also been able to express it algebraically, I want to think about what the marginal revenue is at any one of these points. And to think about marginal revenue is just how much does our total revenue change given some change in our quantity? And then later we can use that so that we can optimize the profit for our monopoly over here. And I'm going to try to do it without calculus. It'd actually be very straightforward to do it with calculus, so we're essentially just trying to find the slope at any point along this curve. But I'll try to do it algebraically, and maybe it'll even give you a little intuition for what we end up doing eventually in calculus. So the first thing I want to do is essentially find the slope right over here. And the best way to find the slope right over here is say, well, how much does my total revenue change if I have a very small change in quantity? So if I have a very small change in quantity, how much does my total revenue change? So let me think about it this way. And the other ones I will be able to approximate a little bit easier. So let's think of it this way. If my quantity is 0, my total revenue is 0. That one's easy. If I increase my quantity very, very, very, very little, so let's just make it 0.001, what is going to be my total revenue? And we could think about it in terms of this curve right over here, or we could just use this expression, which we derived from price times quantity. And we will get my calculator out. If our quantity is 0.001, our total revenue is going to be negative. Let me turn the calculator on. Total revenue is going to be negative 0.001 squared, so that's that part, plus 6 times 0.001. So that's going to be our total revenue. So it's going to be 0.005999. So it's 0.00599. And so now we can figure out or get a pretty good approximation for that marginal revenue right at that point. Our change in quantity is 0.001, so our delta Q, this right over here, is 0.001. That's our change in quantity. And our change in revenue is 0.00599. And so we just have to divide 0.005999, that top one, our change in total revenue, divided by our change in quantity, divided by 0.001. And we get 5.99999. And if you try it with even smaller numbers, if you tried this with 0.000001, you'll get 5 point and you'll get even more 9s going on. So the closer that you get, the smaller your change in, and this is what you essentially do in calculus, you try to find a super small change right over here. This is essentially going to be 6. Our marginal revenue at this point is essentially going to be 6. So what I want to do is I want to plot marginal revenue here on our demand curve as well, or on this axis where we've already plotted our demand curve. So when our quantity is 0, our marginal revenue, if we just barely increase quantity, the incremental total revenue we get is going to be 6. So I'll just plot it right over there. And that makes sense. The marginal benefit in the market is 6 right at that point. So if we were to just sell a drop of orange juice, or I guess we're selling oranges in this case, not juice, but if we were to sell a millionth of a pound of oranges, we would get the equivalent of roughly $6 per pound for that millionth of a pound, because that's the marginal benefit for that very first incremental chunk of orange out there in the market. So it makes complete sense. Now let's think about the slope at these other points. And these I'm going to approximate. I could do it this way, but I'll just approximate it by using other points. So if I want to find the slope right over here, when our quantity is equal to 1, the slope would look like that. And I'm going to approximate it by finding the slope between these two points. I'm going to approximate it, and actually it's going to be a very good approximation. I'll do it later with calculus to show that it is a very good approximation. But I'm going to approximate it by the slope between these two points. And between those two points, our change in quantity is 2, and our change in total revenue is 8. Our change in total revenue is 8. When we produced 2, our total revenue, or 2,000 pounds, our total revenue was $8,000. So we have a change in total revenue of 8, or 8,000 I guess we could say, divided by a change in quantity of 2,000. So our marginal revenue at this point is 8 divided by 2, or 8,000 divided by 2,000, which is $4 per pound. So when our quantity is 1, our marginal revenue is $4 per pound. Just like that. Now let's think about the marginal revenue when our quantity is 2. And to do that, I'm going to find the slope between these two points. We really want to find the slope of that line, but it looks like the slope between these two points is a pretty good approximation. It's actually almost an exact number because the way that this is just a parabola, so we can actually do this. But anyway, this is fairly straightforward. Once again, our change in quantity is 2, and our change in total revenue is, we're going from 5 to 9, which is 4. This was 9 right over here from the last video. Or you could say it's $4,000 divided by 2,000 pounds gives you $2 per pound. So our marginal revenue right over here, if we have quantity of 2, is $2 per pound. Right at that point, for that incremental millionth of an ounce that we're going to sell of oranges, we're getting the equivalent of $2 a pound of increased total revenue from doing that. And let's just do one more point here, and I think you'll see why I'm only going to do one more point. If we try to go up here, and we try to figure out what is the marginal revenue, or if we essentially say what is the slope there, how much do we get an increase in revenue if we just barely increase our quantity? And this is actually easier to look at. This is a maximum point right over here in the calculus terms. The slope up there is 0. We can even see that by approximating the slope between the slope between these two points. We have some change in quantity, but we have no change in total revenue. So right at that point, right over here, the slope is barely positive. Right at that point, the slope is 0. And then right past it, it becomes barely negative. But right at that point, our marginal revenue is 0. So when our quantity is 3,000 pounds, our marginal revenue is 0. And then after that, our marginal revenue gets negative. Over here, our marginal revenue gets more and more negative. But something very interesting happens. When we plot our marginal revenue curve, or our line in this case, we are getting a line that is twice as steep as our demand curve. And this is actually generalizable. If we have a linear demand curve like this, it can be defined as a line, then your marginal revenue curve for the monopolist will also be a linear downward sloping curve, or downward sloping line, and it will have twice the slope. So this slope over here was negative 1. This slope over here is negative 2. For every increase in quantity, the price goes down by 2. Increase in quantity, price goes down by 2. Increase in quantity, price goes down by 2. So this is marginal revenue. And let's remind ourselves. You know, we were doing all of this algebra and all of this math here. What is marginal revenue telling us? This was the demand curve. It tells us for any given price, what quantity is demanded, or for any given quantity, what is the incremental marginal benefit, or I guess what's the price at which they could sell that quantity. From that, we were able to figure out the total revenue as a function of quantity. And from that total revenue, we were able to say, well, look, at any of these quantities, if we were to increase a little bit more, if we were to increase quantity a little bit more, how much is our revenue increasing? And so obviously, we want to keep increasing quantity while our revenue is, well, while the marginal revenue we get is larger than our marginal cost. And I'll take that up in the next video."
dab97619-6583-4581-a965-0ff6cb37c1be,"Before we dive deep into our study of government and politics, it's worth asking a fundamental question, and that's whether we even need government or why do we need government. And I encourage you to pause this video and think about this. Do you think we need government and why or do you think we don't need government and why? Okay, now let's start to reason through this a little bit and start to think about the benefits or the pitfalls of a government. So let's say that we are in a world without a government. And this is me right over here. And at first it sounds pretty good. I have unlimited rights here. There's no one infringing on my right. I can say what I want. I have the freest possible speech. There are no laws that I could break. I have the freest possible religion. I have no government telling me what to practice or what I can't practice. I have, I can own what I want. I have property. I can go anywhere. So I have movement. And I also have some freedoms that those of us who live in a government don't typically have. So I would have the freedom to tax others or to take from others, take property. If I'm stronger than them or if I'm just sneakier, I go in the middle of the night, I can just take their property from them. I could just settle on their land. I could have the freedom to punish others or imprison others if I don't like them. It doesn't even have to be for a reason. This is a freedom that most of us don't have in the world that we live in today. But without a government, I would have this freedom, this freedom to go and take stuff from others and to do physical harm or imprison them or enslave them. Now this might sound good to you as an individual, but remember, everyone in this governmentless society would have these same freedoms. And I especially like the ability to have my own property and to have my own freedom of movement. But what if this person right over here doesn't like me to have freedom of movement and so they say, they're going to invoke, look, I can punish or imprison you because I don't like you. And so they're going to infringe on my freedom of movement by imprisoning me. Or maybe I might do it to someone else. And so even though you have all of these freedoms, because everyone else does, especially these latter few, they might be able to take some of these from you, including your freedom to live, your health, your happiness. And this is well-described in political philosophy. In particular, you have a gentleman by the name of Thomas Hobbes who's considered one of the fathers of political philosophy. And this is what he had to say about this state of nature. As long as men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in the condition known as war. And it is a war of every man against every man. In war, the two chief virtues are force and fraud. I can do something by physical force or I could trick you or I could sneak around you and take something from you or imprison you. A further fact about the state of war of every man against every man, in it, there is no such thing as ownership, no legal control, no distinction between mine and thine, between mine and yours. Rather, anything that a man can get is his for as long as he can keep it. In such a condition, every man has a right to everything, even to someone else's body. As long as this continues, therefore, that is, as long as every man continues to have this natural right to everything, no man, however strong or clever he may be, can be sure of living out the time that nature ordinarily allows men to live. This was written in Leviathan, which was published in 1651. So he's framing the same thing. If everyone has a right to everything, well, they can infringe on other people, including their life, their health, their happiness, their freedom to movement. Now, some of you might be skeptical of this. You might say, look, humans are fundamentally good. If you give them that freedom, they have a conscience, they're not going to try to do this to other people. But some of you might be able to cite times in society where there's more of an anarchy, where actually people might devolve. And even if one or two or three, or even if a majority of the people have a conscience and aren't willing to imprison others and punish people arbitrarily, if even a few people are not willing to respect other people's rights, everything might devolve. And it's worth talking about the historical context here, because this was near the end of the English Civil War, where there was chaos, where people were asking these questions, well, what type of government should we have? And when there isn't a strong government, all of this chaos is really all about person versus person. It wasn't this degree of chaos that Hobbes is writing about, this kind of natural state without government, but this was a context where there was a lot of bloodshed, a lot of war, and a lot of chaos. Now, Hobbes had a solution, and this is actually why the book was called Leviathan. He was an advocate of a very strong central government. This keeps people in awe, alludes to what he's thinking of. Leviathan comes from the Old Testament, or the Hebrew Bible. It's the name of a sea monster. But Hobbes thinks that a government should be a leviathan to keep everyone in check. He wrote, when a man thinks that peace and self-defense require it, he should be willing, when others are too, to lay down his right to everything, and should be contented with as much liberty against other men as he would allow other men against himself. Now, this idea that he's talking about, this is today referred to as a social, social contract. And this term, social contract, is first formally used by Rousseau, another Enlightenment author, about 100 years later, talking about this willingness to give up some rights in order to protect the ones that you really, really, really wanna have. And you would be giving up those rights to some form of a government. That is the social contract between the people that are governed and the government that governs them. So going back to that previous example where every person was out for themselves, what the social contract is saying is, well, look, certain of these rights I really wanna keep, my freedom of speech, my freedom of property, my freedom to move around, my freedom to have my life, my health, my happiness, in order to protect those freedoms, maybe I'm willing to give some of my other freedoms over to a central authority as long as everyone is willing to give these up. And this central authority that we give it up to is a government. And the government, because it has this, it uses these rights in order to protect the other rights, the ones that I really want to keep. So the government enforces these other rights, and that's the social contract. I give away these rights in order to protect the ones that I really, really care about. And that makes sense, but it still leaves a very, very big question. What form should this government take? I'm willing to engage in this social contract, but how does this government govern? How are the leaders selected? What are the constraints on that government? And that will be our focus as we study government and politics."
3895fe85-3375-4874-8304-ed0a72a3eefe,"If we were to rewind the clock back about 70 million years, you would see dinosaurs roaming the Earth. And this is a very nice picture here of a dinosaur enjoying a sunset at the beach. But unfortunately for the dinosaurs, about 65 million years ago, we believe that a huge meteorite struck the Earth and essentially wiped out the dinosaurs. And they probably wiped out a bunch of other species with it, because you can imagine the shock wave itself would just exterminate tons of species. Then you would have the tsunami of unimaginable size that would just envelop the continents for some period of time. And then you would have all of the soot that would go into the air and maybe make it impossible for most of the plant species to live, because it would be blocking out all of the sunlight. And so in an environment like that, we could imagine that an animal like this would be well-suited to survive. It's sitting there underground. Maybe it can hibernate in some way, so it doesn't need food for long periods of time. Maybe it has its own food stash under there someplace. And so we believe that our ancient ancestors, after this mass extinction event, might have been something like this, kind of a mole-looking rodent animal that was protected from all of this craziness that was happening on the surface, because they like to hang out underground and have all their food nearby them, and maybe they could hibernate in some way. So you can imagine once everything settled down, and now we're talking, who knows, hundreds of years, thousands of years, even millions of years, some of this guy's descendants start to poke their head out of the ground. They're like, you know what? There's food in trees, and there's no one else in the trees, and trees are a good place to maybe get away from some of the other predators that have managed to survive this mass extinction event. And some of its ancestors, or some of its descendants, I should say, that were good at climbing trees decide, hey, let's try this tree thing out. And so you started to have some selection for the descendants of this rodent that could climb trees well. They were able to find food where their ancestors couldn't. They could find protection in the trees where their ancestors couldn't. And so you could imagine that some subset of this guy's descendants evolved into something that might have looked like this guy. And all the pictures I'm showing you, these are of modern animals, except for, of course, the dinosaur. I'm sure this was kind of Photoshopped in in some way. This is a modern bush baby, but I show this picture because it could have been what some of these primitive primates looked like. Because a bush baby, it kind of climbs trees. It kind of looks like it's starting to get a hand here to start climbing the trees, but it also has rodent-like qualities. But this is, of course, a modern version of it. So this bush baby's ancient, ancient, ancient ancestor might have been that primitive primate or that species of primitive primate that was a descendant of rodents that started to say, hey, let's see if we can climb these trees and find some food. And then some of its descendants might have had just the right adaptations, found their own little niche in the right ecosystems, and they would have evolved into monkeys. Once again, this is a modern monkey, but you could imagine some type of primitive monkey. And then some of those primitive monkeys' descendants, they turn into these modern monkeys eventually, but some of them, they grow larger in size. They spend more time outside of trees. They lose their tail. They don't need it as much for balance. Maybe it's actually a bad thing to have because someone else could grab it when you're in a fight or something like that. And they evolve into apes, and in particular, the great apes. So one of the great apes, the great apes involve gorillas and chimpanzees, and chimpanzees and the ancestor, or really the great apes also include humanity. So let me just review back on this timeline just so that we don't get confused. I'll review what we just talked about. So before this mass extinction event, 65 million years ago, you had all these types of species here. Maybe this right up here, maybe this was, actually if I'm talking about species, maybe this was Tyrannosaurus rex because the dinosaurs involve a whole bunch of, so this might have been T. rex. And there's a bunch of species that we could list over here. But after that mass extinction event, that was an endpoint for a ton of species except for maybe this primitive rodent mole-like thing that was, you know, maybe a lot of them died in this event, but just enough of them survived because they were underground or just in the right place or they were in a mountain someplace. Who knows where they were. And some of them were able to evolve into primitive primates. And some of those primitive primates, and this is once again, these are pictures of primitive primates. Some of those primitive, and when I say primitive, these are modern versions of them. So primitive doesn't necessarily mean worse because obviously these guys were able to find even in today's world, they have a niche for themselves. They're able to find food and reproduce in ways that, you know, don't get in the way of other people and other way people don't get in the way of them. When I talk about primitive primate, I'm just talking about kind of an ancestral primate, maybe something that's not there today. Although maybe some of its descendants look very much like it. But anyway, some of those primates evolve into primitive monkeys. Some of those primitive monkeys' descendants become modern monkeys. So this is, I'll call it M monkeys for modern monkeys. And some of them evolve into primitive apes. And apes, their distinctive characteristic is that they're like monkeys, but they don't have tails and they're larger than most monkeys. And so these primitive apes, some of their descendants are modern gorillas. At some point, they break off. Some of these descendants are a ancestor of both modern chimpanzees and of human beings. And we think, just looking at the DNA evidence, we think that this departure right here and the fossil evidence was about 7 million years ago. That's our best guess for when we as human beings had a common ancestor with the chimpanzees. Now, you have that common ancestor. Some of that common ancestor's descendants became modern chimpanzees. And some of them, maybe they explored the right ecosystem where it was more advantageous to do so, started to walk on two legs. And the most famous fossil of this is the Australopithecine fossil of Lucy that was discovered 3.2 million years... It was discovered more recently. It's 3.2 million years old. So the whole genus, and genus is kind of one level of categorization above species, the whole genus of Australopithecine, these were 4 to 2 million years ago. 4 to 2. And we never know. You could always find a fossil that's older than this, maybe newer than this. I read one account that says maybe 1 million years ago. But give or take, the Lucy fossil, which is the most well-established Australopithecine fossil, is about 3 million years old. And this is a reconstruction I have over here of Lucy. So this is probably what Lucy looked like. And once again, there were many Lucys. It wasn't just there was one Lucy and we're all descended from Lucys. And it's actually not even clear that we are even descended directly from Australopithecine. We might be a cousin species, or a cousin genus, I should say. Genus is the category right above species. So if you fast forward a little bit more, you go to about 2.3 to 1.4 million years ago. We see fossils that they're standing upright. The brain size is bigger. Because if you look at the Australopithecine fossils, they are standing upright, but their cranial capacity isn't that different than chimpanzees. You fast forward to 2.3 million to 1.4 million years ago, we start to see fossils where they're standing upright still, and the cranial capacity has grown, and you're starting to see primitive stone tools around the bone fossils. And so we believe that these are one of the first, and this is really just how we categorize it, but these are some of the first fossils that we categorize as belonging to the same genus as ours. And the genus is Homo. And Homo just means man. So it's the group right above species of man. And we call them similar to man because it looks like they're starting to make primitive stone tools. They stand upright like us, and they have larger cranial capacities than the Australopithecine fossils or modern chimpanzees. And once again, we don't know if Homo habilis, which literally means, so the Homo part means man, habilis means handy because he liked to, I guess, make tools or whatever else. We don't know if Homo habilis is a descendant of Lucy's species of Australopithecus or maybe a cousin species. Maybe they're both descendants from some common ancestor. We're not quite sure. Then you fast forward a little bit more. We're talking now about 1.8. So now we're talking about 1.8 to 1.3 million years ago. And we start seeing fossils where the cranial capacity, larger than Homo habilis, getting closer in size to what our notion is of a modern person's cranial capacity, at least relative to body size. And this is Homo erectus. And once again, we don't know if Homo erectus is a descendant of Homo habilis. Maybe they have a common ancestor. Who knows? And it looks from the fossil evidence that there was, especially when you look at this range here, that there was some overlap where you had both Homo erectus and Homo habilis living on the same planet at the same time. Now you fast forward even more and we think about 600,000 to 300,000. Once again, all of these are constantly being modified as we get better at finding new fossils or interpreting the fossils we have or we look at DNA evidence or whatever. About 600,000 to 300,000 years ago, you have the Neanderthals appear. And Neanderthals are in the same genus as humans. So it's really Homo neanderthalensis. I always have trouble saying this. So this is still part of Homo. And a common misconception is that the Neanderthals are somehow a more primitive version of humans, that they're somehow cavemen and we're modern men. That's not the case. The belief is that Neanderthals are either a cousin species, we have a common ancestor, or that they're actually a subspecies of human beings. And there's some belief that they might have interbred with Homo sapiens. And maybe some or a good number of us have Neanderthal genes. It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's just something, unfortunately, that Neanderthals just get a bad name because of, I guess, our popular culture, if anything. So this is a drawing of a Neanderthal brain. They actually had a fairly large cranial capacity, although scientists say they kind of make one reason or another why we think that they might have been more primitive than Homo sapien. But who knows? We don't know. We're constantly learning things every day. But of course, the whole point of this is to talk about how humans showed up on this planet. And the first really human fossils we find about 200,000 years ago. And this, remember, we're in the genus Homo, and now we finally found something that looks just like us anatomically, at least. We can't study its behavior and all the rest. And now we get to Homo sapiens. The Homo part, once again, means man. And the sapiens means thinking. So we can debate whether it's an appropriate title for our species, but it's thinking man. So once again, the Neanderthals, they were either a cousin species for a lot of this time, especially once Homo sapiens showed up. And maybe Homo sapiens showed up before this. We just haven't found the fossils yet. They were maybe both inhabiting the same planet. Maybe there was some interbreeding. But the Neanderthals disappeared about 30,000 years ago. These guys disappeared. Maybe some of them kind of got mixed in with the Homo sapiens, started to interbreed with them. Or they might have just been killed off because they were fighting over the same ecosystems. And I've made a little sample here of Homo sapiens just in case, well, I'm assuming most of you watching this video are one, but just in case, here's my little sample. We can debate how representative of a sample of our species this really is."
aa70824b-d8fc-4c97-8430-74babff5a968,"It's estimated that our galaxy, the Milky Way, has 100 to 400 billion stars. And when you hear a number like that, the obvious question is, are there civilizations on planets that are orbiting any of these stars? And maybe an even more interesting question is, can we detect any of those civilizations? Have they gotten to the level of technological progress like us, that they're emitting electromagnetic waves into space that other civilizations like ours can detect and say, hey, there's someone else out there watching television or using radio or whatever else they might be doing. And so what I want to do in this video is not answer that question. It's a big open question. We don't know the answer. We don't have anywhere near enough information to definitively answer that question. What I want to do is come up with a framework for at least thinking about that question, a way of actually estimating how many detectable civilizations there are in just our galaxy. And there's a formula that you may or may not have heard of called the Drake Equation. And what we're going to do is independently derive our own version of the Drake Equation. It's going to be slightly different, but it's the same thought process. And in a future video, I'm going to maybe reconcile what we come up with with the Drake Equation. And just so you know, the Drake Equation is named for Frank Drake, who is a professor at University of California, Santa Cruz. He first kind of put some structure around this problem, and that's why the formula or the equation has his name. But the equation, it's not an equation that you can apply on a daily basis and get results that you can use to build things. But what it is is structures are thinking around this question of how many detectable civilizations are there in our galaxy. Now to answer this question, I'm going to start a little bit differently than Frank Drake did. He starts with the number of new stars that are born each year. And we'll see that our definitions are actually pretty close to each other. What I want to do is start with the total number of stars. So what we're trying to come up with is, I'll call it N, and this is the number of detectable civilizations in the Milky Way, in our galaxy. And once again, there could be civilizations, looking back at this star field right over here. This star right over here, maybe it has a planet that's in the right place, it has liquid water, and maybe there's intelligent life on that planet. But they might not be detectable, because they aren't technologically advanced enough that they're using electromagnetic radiation, or maybe they just figured out some other way to communicate, or maybe they're beyond using electromagnetic radiation, radio waves and all the rest, to communicate, and so we'll never be able to detect them. We're talking about civilizations like ours, that are to some degree using technology not too different than our own. So that's what we mean by detectable. So let's think about that a little bit. So I like to start with just the total number of stars in our solar system. So let's just start with, I'll call it N star and asterisks, and this is the number of stars in our galaxy. And our best guess, I said, is this is going to be 100 billion to 400 billion stars. We don't even know how many there are. Some of them are undetectable. In the center of our galaxy, it's just a big blur to us. We don't even know what's on the other side of that, and we can't even see all the stars that are packed into the center. So this is our best guess, 100 billion to 400 billion stars. Now obviously, it's going to be a subset of those stars that even have planets. So let's multiply it times that subset. So let's multiply it times the frequency of having a planet. If you're a star, this is the percent chance or the frequency or the fraction of these stars that have planets. So I'll write it this way, fraction that have planets. So if this is 100 billion, and let's say I'm making a guess here, and we're learning more about this every day, there are all these discoveries of exoplanets, planets outside of our solar system. Maybe this is one-fourth. Then we could say, well, that means that 100 billion times one-fourth means that there are 25 billion stars that have planets around them. But that's still not enough to go to civilizations. We also need to think about planets, because a planet could be a planet like Jupiter, and we don't know how life as we know it can survive on a planet like Jupiter or on Neptune or Mercury. It has to have planets that are good for sustaining life, preferably have a rocky core, liquid water on the outside. That's what we think are the ingredients that you need for life. Maybe we're just not being creative enough. That's what we know as life as being. So let's multiply this times the average number of life-sustaining or planets that could sustain life on them. So we don't necessarily know that they're going to have life, but they seem like they're just the right distance from the star, not too hot, not too cold. They have the right amount of gravity, water, all the other stuff, and we still don't know exactly what this means, but this means average number. So given that there's a solar system with planets, what's the average number of planets that are capable of sustaining life? And once again, we don't know this answer. Maybe it's 0.1. It's probably less than 1. For any given solar system that has planets, the average number capable of sustaining life, maybe it's 0.1. Maybe it's more than 1. I don't know. We don't know the exact answer here, but I'll throw out a guess. Maybe it is 0.1. And here, the fraction that have planets, I don't know. I'll throw that out. And once again, I'm just making up these numbers. We really don't know the right answer. This is one-fourth. But if we were to multiply this out, we would have the average number of planets in our solar system that are capable of sustaining life, that are around stars, that have planets, and these planets are capable of sustaining life. Now, and this would give us the total number because this is average per solar system that has planets. This is the total number of solar systems with planets. You multiply it out, total number of planets in our galaxy capable of sustaining life. Now, just because you have liquid water and the right temperature and all of the rest of the ingredients doesn't necessarily mean that you will actually have life happening on your planet. So let's multiply that times the fraction that actually generate life. So this is the fraction that actually have life. And this is actually a very, we don't know this answer. So this is the fraction that have life on them. And this is a really big open question. Maybe if you have the ingredients, maybe almost every planet has life. Maybe it's a frequent thing that's happening in our galaxy and frankly our universe. Or maybe it's a very infrequent thing. Maybe it's just the right kind of freak set of circumstances that just have to happen. I'll throw out a number just for the sake of just to have a number there. Maybe it's one out of every ten planets that have all of the right ingredients for life actually do generate life. My personal guess is probably higher than that given that life seems such a robust and flexible thing that we've been seeing in all sorts of weird circumstances. Actually, let me make it even a higher number than that. So let me make it one half assuming that we have all of the ingredients. So this should tell us essentially how many planets, if we were to multiply all of these, how many planets in our galaxy have had life on them at some point in those planets' lives. The life might have come and gone. It may have destroyed itself through nuclear war or whatever, but this would tell us the number of life planets in our galaxy that have had life on them at at least one point in their history. Now, we care about civilization. So let's multiply this times, if you make all of these, you even get to the point that you have life, we care about, well, do you get intelligent life? So maybe if the asteroid never hit Earth, the dinosaurs would have stayed on Earth and they would have never evolved to the point of generating radios and TVs and telephones and all the rest. So it's kind of a freak circumstance that because they were destroyed, these gaps in the ecosystem developed so that we could emerge and be intelligent and do all of these crazy things like make YouTube videos and all the rest. So let's multiply this times the fraction. If you get all of this, the fraction that actually end up having intelligent life. And maybe this fraction is intelligent life. Intelligent life over here. So intelligent life, this is maybe, I'll throw out a number, one-tenth. And probably in the next video, I'll calculate it all. And this is very important to realize because once again, you could have life. These are all examples of life right over here. This is actually life on our planet, even though this looks quite alien. This is a weevil that kind of looked very close up. But there's all sorts of forms of life, many of which we probably can't even begin to imagine. But what we care is that intelligent life starts to emerge on the planet because only intelligent life has a chance, we believe, of being able to eventually communicate in ways that are detectable by us. Now, I said intelligent life, but maybe not all intelligent life will eventually get to the technological sophistication where they will be using radio waves and electromagnetic radiation to communicate with each other. Maybe we might have stagnated at this stage if the right things didn't happen. So what we need to do now is multiply this. So right here, we would have the number of planets in our galaxy that have had intelligent life on them at some point in their history, maybe not at a time that coincides with ours. But what we want to do is whittle it down even more to the percentage that get to the point that they can develop technology that allows us to detect them. So they're kind of... So let me multiply it times the fraction that are... I'll put a C here for maybe they're using communications, C for communications, that allow us to detect them. So this is detectable, the fraction that are detectable. Now, you might think that we're done. This would give you the total number of civilizations or life forms in our galaxy or the planets that have life forms that developed detectable technologies at some point in their history. Now, it would be nice if civilizations did not kind of be born and then die, but the reality is they do die. They might destroy themselves or whatever, and they might exist for only a small period of time for the history of that planet or the history of that solar system. So in order to make it the number of civilizations that are in existence now, and I'll clarify what now means in the next video because it's really, if we're detecting something from a star that's 10,000 light years away, our now means we're just receiving their signals, which means that they released the signals 10,000 years ago. But what I want to do is, what is the fraction of these whose signals are reaching us right now? And here, I'm going to say, well, what's the average lifespan of a civilization? I'll put that L. Who knows what that is? Maybe 10,000 years. So civilization lifespan. And it's going to be that over the life of the star. So that is over, I'll put a T here, T for the star. So the average lifespan for the star. And I could say the average lifespan for the planet or whatever, but we're assuming that once our star supernovas, you're not going to have any chance for Earth to develop life on it anymore. So maybe this thing up here is 10,000 years, and this down here is maybe 10 billion years. And if you were to multiply all of this out, you should get the number of detectable civilizations in our galaxy right now. I'll leave you there for this video. In the next video, we'll discuss it a little bit more and reconcile it with the more famous version of Drake's equation. And I'll also try to talk about this piece a little bit because I think this might be a little bit confusing, and I'll try to diagram that out a little bit more."
95211260-6617-48a8-8484-dbfa5680a889,"In the last video, I've mentioned how I've been asked to make predictions for the year 2060. In the last one, I focused on education. That's obviously what I'm working on now, so I have some opinions about that. But what I want to do in this video is do maybe slightly more broad and wild predictions. And my one prediction I'll make is I'm probably completely not going to predict the real reality of 2060. And probably the really big things to predict I will completely miss. But with that out of the way, it is fun to predict things, so let's give a shot. So the first area that I will predict is what's going to happen in the field of medicine. In particular, I think that the human lifespan is going to increase dramatically. So I'll be conservative and say that the lifespan, the average human lifespan, is going to be, especially in the developed world, and once again, hopefully by 2060, most of the world is developed, the average human lifespan is going to be over 100 years old. And I won't say whether that's going to be a good or a bad thing. There's arguments either way about the proper way to live and what happens to global populations. But if the world is, for the most part, developed and educated, you actually will probably have a lower rate of reproduction, and so you might actually have some space in the world for older people. But this, I think, is there's a very strong chance of this happening because we are starting to understand the molecular basis of aging. It's not a given thing that, because of some form of wear and tear, things have to die after 70 years or 80 years or 90 years, and we're starting to understand the mechanisms and how to maybe improve the repair mechanisms or how to augment it in some way. So I definitely think this is going to happen. I don't know whether it's going to be a positive or negative, but it's likely to happen. The next thing, and this is kind of closely related, this is still biological, is you're going to have a close integration between the digital and the biological. So digital and biological. And once again, I won't make any statement of whether this is a good or a bad thing, but it seems like it's just an extrapolation of the direction we're already going in, digital and biological integration. So already, you're getting more and more in your handheld devices. Imagine when your screen is now no longer in your palm, but it's being projected onto your retina from some little thing, and then eventually you have a direct connection with your retina, and your brain can directly access areas of memory through some biological and digital interface. So I definitely think this is going to happen. This is a big deal, because this is starting to, and I think it's already happening with a lot of what you see around technology, it's really going to reshape what the individual human experience is going to be. We already see people kind of living in virtual realities and playing these immersive games and spending all of their time on social networking platforms. What happens when they're literally plugged in all the time, when almost their cell phone is in the brain? I don't know. I'm not going to comment whether it's a good or a bad thing, but it does look like a trend that's going to keep on going through the next 50 years. Now, if we take that even further, we're talking about a digital and biological integration, but if you go at the extreme, and actually it's probably both of these top two things combined in some way, is that we are learning, and once again, not making a comment whether it's good or bad, it's just an extrapolation of what we're already seeing. We are seeing more and more ability to understand our genome, to molecularly target things, to manipulate actual biology. And so what you have is that you can actually have, let me write this, manipulation of biology. This is, on some level, creepy. It could be creepy or it could be exciting, depending on how it all plays out, but it could do things like augment intelligence, augment human intelligence, which would, if you think about all the progress of society and all the things that are already accelerating, imagine how society will change if intelligence itself is augmented. As someone with a limited intelligence, I can't even imagine what will happen as soon as you do this. And obviously, the more you augment intelligence, the more that you can learn how to augment intelligence and increase lifespan and do digital and biological integration even more. So these things I see as some form of a trend. We'll see how it all plays out, and hopefully it plays out in the feel-good Care Bear version versus some type of crazy society, and we all turn into the Borg in some way. Now the other trend, and these are the things that just popped into my brain today when I pressed record, but the other trend that I think is interesting is some of the things that we've taken for granted in terms of how nations interact with each other, and nation states in particular interact with each other. And just as a kind of an overview, so there's a notion called a nation state. And in everyday language, the word nation and the word state almost means the same thing, but they kind of mean different things if you want to be a little bit more formal about them. That's why people use the word nation state. That's like, to a lot of people, it doesn't mean saying like state, state. The difference between a nation and a state is these are a group of people that feel some type of common identity. It could be a language. It could be a culture. It could be a value system. So this is some kind of common identity, and it often is somehow associated with geography, but it does not have to be associated with geography. It could even be a religion or it could be whatever else. That's what a nation is. A state is a formal governance structure that makes the laws and has the institutions to make society function. Now, a nation state is what most of us live in today because it both has an identity and some type of formal institutions. So a very pure nation state would be someplace like Japan where there's relatively uniform in terms of ethnicity and religion and in terms of culture, and you have that same group of people are governing themselves. In a place like the United States, ethnicity, religion, that's diverse, but what gives identity is a notion of shared values and a notion of maybe a common history or whatever else or a certain kind of world view, and obviously there's a formal state structure. Now, what I think is going to be interesting here, and I actually have no idea how all of this is going to play out, but when you see things like some of the revolutions in the Middle East due to things like people being able to communicate irrespective of the traditional media, I think there's going to be some interesting questions on what happens to the nation state, especially nation states that are able to secure their power by kind of having a bottleneck on access to information, and all of that is, I think, going to change in a very dramatic way as you have more and more integration between people, cross-border communications, when people realize that the people on the other side of the border really aren't that different than themselves. And another interesting thing, even the notion of democracy, and once again, I don't know how it's going to play out, but all notions of representational democracy that we have today are somewhat based on geography. They're somewhat based on geography, and that's because when the major representational democracies came about, that was the best way to represent each other. Hey, let me pick some representatives from our county or from our region, and they'll go elect other representatives, and they'll go to the national government. But now that we have this instantaneous communication with people, you might be able to have different types of a representational democracy, or maybe you could even have more direct democracies. Who knows? Because of things like communication and technology and whatever else. And then the other way that I think nation-states or the way they fundamentally interact is going to change is actually in things like warfare. And once again, already seeing this trend. In particular, I think developed countries are not going to have humans on the front line. No humans. No humans on the front line. And depending on your point of view, this could be a very good thing, or it could be a kind of a scary thing. Because if you have no humans on the front line, and you're already seeing things like this with these predator drones, and you see these robot bomb detectors and things like that, and it doesn't even have to be these big things. There's already a DARPA-funded project to work on miniature insects that could be used as some form of reconnaissance, or you could imagine eventually they could have these little things on them that could knock someone out, or who knows what they do. The exciting thing is that all of a sudden a human won't be there to get shot, and so hopefully military casualties would go down. The scary thing here is if you don't have humans on the front line, nations might be willing to enter into war, especially developed nations. They might not take it as seriously, and so it might be something that they do a little bit more when they're in the mood. And it would actually create a huge disparity between developed and developing nations when this happens, and you already see that to a certain degree. A developed nation, they don't have to put as many humans in harm's way, and it's purely driven by their wealth to have capital that can go, these robots and these drones, and their technological innovation, while in the developing countries they actually would have to use human beings, so their costs would be much, much, much, much higher. So it's an interesting question, and once again, who knows how this plays out, whether it's a good or bad thing in the long term. I think a similar thing with this is I think you're going to see more and more nonlethal weapons, nonlethal weapons, which once again, it's very similar to this. It sounds like it's a good thing. If there's a gun that instead of having to kill someone, it incapacitates them in some way or it stuns them in some way, kind of the classic Star Trek put your phasers on stun things, I guess the scarier version of nonlethal weapons is the threshold for using it becomes much lower. So if a government wants to subject its citizens or subject another group of citizens, it can literally just stun them or it can make them pass out or it can control them in some way. So this could be a little bit scarier. So who knows how all of this plays out. So those are my predictions or things to think about over the next 50 years. These are just the things that happened to jump into my brain today, probably based on some of the science fiction books I've been reading or whatever else, but take them with a huge grain of salt. I don't know if these things are really going to happen or not and I don't know if they're even a good thing or not, but they seem to be a bit of an extrapolation of what we're already seeing."
02bd1da5-ec1a-42b1-8fd5-46ce3181f7ef,"This right here is a fresco by Raphael of Plato hanging out with his best student, Aristotle. And you may or may not know that these two fellows, along with Plato's teacher, Socrates, are considered kind of the fathers of Western philosophy. But that's not what this video is about. This is actually just a small little video about different dates, or maybe a better way to think about it, different ways to specify dates or dating mechanisms. And so if you were to look up Plato's birth, you might get either 428 or 427, but we'll go with 428. If you were to look up Plato's birth, you might see it written as 428 BC, or you might see it written as 428 BCE. And the natural question is, well, what's the difference here? They both have a BC, but this one has an E. It's the same year right now. And the answer is that these are referring to the exact same year in history, but the acronyms here do stand for different things. BC literally stands for before Christ. So if the date is written 428 BC, the implication is that this is 428 years before the birth of Christ. We'll see in a second that that's not exactly right, but that's what the implication is. If someone writes BCE, they're saying something very different. The B still stands for before, but the C in CE does not stand for Christ anymore. It now stands for common. And so the CE part is common era, even though it's not referring to Christ anymore. And the intention here is so that it's, I guess, less religious than the term before Christ. It's still kind of putting an importance on Christ's birth, because it's saying that the common era is the time period after the birth of Christ, which we'll see in a second isn't exactly right. But there's essentially the same exact dating scheme, one not directly referring to Christ, one that is directly referring to Christ. Similarly, this right here is a painting of Christopher Columbus. And if you were to look up in history books, when was his first voyage, and when did he first show up in the New World, finding an island in the Bahamas, you would see it written as either 1492 or AD 1492 or 1492 CE. And once again, these are all referring to the same year, just using different acronyms. One of them's a little bit more religious, or more directly refers to Christ, and one is a little less religious. So AD, some people think it refers to after death. It does not refer to after death. Because if you think about it, if you have years before the birth of Christ, and if you started numbering after his death, how would you number the years during his life? So AD does not stand for after death. It stands for Anno Domini, which literally means year, and domini means Lord, or the Lord. So it's the year of the Lord, or the year of our Lord. So it's years since, and one Anno Domini would be the year of Jesus Christ's birth. So not after death, it stands for Anno Domini, but literally the year of our Lord. So years since that Jesus was born, with year one implicitly starting with his birth. And we'll see in a second, that's not exactly right. CE stands for Common Era. Once again, 1 CE is the same thing as AD 1. Sometimes we now write, instead of writing AD 1492, we'll write 1492 AD, all referring to the exact same thing. Now, all of these things refer to, when we say 428 BC, it implies 428 years before the birth of Christ. 1492 AD, that's in the year of our Lord, 1492. It implies 1,492 years since the birth of Christ, but the reality is that we're not really quite sure when Christ was born. So Columbus didn't sail across the Atlantic exactly 1492 years after the birth of Christ. Most historians put the birth of Christ at 7 to 2 BC or BCE, depending on how you want to view it. Remember, BC is before Christ, which is a little ironic because we're talking about the actual birth of Christ. BCE is before the Common Era. And they put his death at 30 to 36 AD, which is 30 to 36 in the year of our Lord, or that's what this stands for, Anno Domini, or in the Common Era, CE. Now, some people, they obviously don't like BC. They don't like the BC AD naming mechanism because it's explicitly referring to Christ. And every year, it makes Christ the central figure in all of history. So they'll say that this is clearly too Christian, and they would prefer the situation, they would prefer the less Christian naming scheme, where you use BCE and CE. But a lot of people would still say, hey, look, OK, you changed, well, you know, first of all, some Christians wouldn't like this, that you removed the direct references to the birth of Christ, or being in the years since Christ's birth. But even here, and they'll say, hey, you've removed it. But even here, some people would complain that although you've made the direct reference, that this is saying before the Common Era and the Common Era, even though you've removed the direct reference, it still makes Christ's birth the central thing in all of history. But this is the convention, whether people like it or not. In order to have the same reference point, it would be too logistically difficult to switch at this time, everyone has essentially settled on this. And it's really just a matter of letters of which naming scheme you pick. But the whole point of this video is that you don't get confused between BC and BCE. You don't think that AD stands for after death, it stands for Anno Domini, the year of the Lord, or the year of our Lord. And CE stands for Common Era. But this and this are referring to essentially the same count after the birth of Christ, or this theoretical birth of Christ, which we don't really know when it actually happened. It probably did not happen at the beginning of 1 AD or 1 CE. And these two things both also refer to the same direction in the timeline. One last thing I want to point out is that there is no year 0. So if you take either of these naming schemes, you have, so let's go very close to the year 1. So there's just some point, this theoretical birth of Christ, which was probably not the actual birth of Christ, but at that theoretical point, right at that, so new years, so you have kind of December 31 of the previous year, all of a sudden now you are on January 1 of 1 AD or CE, depending on how you want to refer to it. And the year before that was 1 BC or BCE, depending on how you want to refer to it. So there is no year 0 in this scheme. And then the last thing I want to emphasize, and it might be obvious to you, is the larger a number you have here, the further back you're going in time. Because this is saying how many years before this theoretical birth of Christ. And obviously larger numbers you have here, this is the further you're going off into the future. And if you wanted to figure out how many years passed between Plato's birth and Columbus sailing across the Atlantic to find the new world, you would say, well look, it took 428 years to go from Plato's birth to this theoretical birth of Christ. And then you have another 1,492 years to wait until Columbus gets his ship together. So the total number of years would be, I'll do it right over here, 428 years to get to Christ from Plato's birth, and then you have another 1,492 years to wait for Columbus. So let's see, 8 plus 2, that is 10. As you can see, I just wanted to add a little arithmetic in this video. So 1 plus 2 plus 9 is 12. And then we have 9, 1 plus 4 plus 4. So 1,920 years between Plato's birth and Columbus sailing across the Atlantic."
5cef0bca-d087-4329-b3a4-41ac86cf9d51,"We left off in the last video in the Archean Eon, and where arche comes from, ancient Greek, it means beginning or origin. And it's the eon in which either life first started to exist, or at least it first started to somewhat flourish. It's possible that maybe life first started to exist at the end of the Hadean Eon. And of course, this boundary is vague. And the Archean Eon is also the first eon where we still have rocks from that time. So we are able to find rocks that we can date to be roughly 3.8 billion years. Now, the other really interesting thing that happened in the Archean Eon, it really has pretty profound effects once we get into the Proterozoic Eon, is that you started to have cyanobacteria produce oxygen. And we said in the last video that they were producing oxygen, but most of that oxygen was being absorbed by iron in the oceans. But what happens as we enter into the Proterozoic Eon, in Proterozoic Eon, this right over here, I don't know if you can see that, I'll rewrite it. Proterozoic. We're now in the Proterozoic Eon that starts up about 2.5 billion years ago. And Proterozoic comes from the Greek for earlier life. And I'm not a Greek scholar, so any of you Greeks out there, forgive me if I'm not getting the translation exactly right. But what's really interesting about the Proterozoic Eon is that that oxygen that was being produced by the cyanobacteria at some point begins to saturate the iron and any other molecule that could have absorbed it before. And once it saturates, it starts to get released into the atmosphere. So the oxygen starts to get released and accumulate in the atmosphere. And we think this started to happen about 2.4 billion years ago. So 2.4 billion years ago, oxygen begins to accumulate in the atmosphere. And of course, these dates, they might be moved around a few hundred million years if you get more and more data. But this is the current understanding of when things happen. And maybe we'll look at the geological record or the fossil record and we'll move these things around in the future. I could only imagine that 50 years from now or 100 years from now, if someone's still watching this video, a lot of this might say, hey, we found out later that oxygen started to accumulate in the atmosphere earlier or later or that eukaryotes occurred earlier or later. But this, as far as I can tell, is our best current understanding. But 2.4 billion years ago, oxygen begins to accumulate in the atmosphere. And what's interesting about this is once it accumulates and once it accumulates, it's kind of a critical amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. And I touched on this in the last video. About 2.3 billion years ago, we have something called the Great Oxygenation Event, sometimes called the Oxygen Catastrophe. And this is right here. They mark it on this right here, 2.3 billion years ago or 2,300 million years ago. Atmosphere becomes oxygen rich. And it's not as oxygen rich as our current atmosphere, but it becomes oxygen rich enough that at least the environment becomes suitable for eukaryotic organisms or eukaryotic cells. Now, the other interesting thing, and we might not care so much about it because we needed the oxygen, is that we think that this was actually the greatest extinction event in the history of Earth. That's why it's called the Oxygen Catastrophe. So this right over here, 2.3 billion years ago, I shouldn't giggle about it. This is a serious matter. This is the greatest extinction event in Earth's history. And I'll do history with a capital H. In Earth's history of the Earth. And that's because the cyanobacteria is producing all this oxygen, eventually saturates the iron. It accumulates in the air. Once it gets to enough concentration, it begins to actually suffocate. It's poisonous. It's poisonous to most of the other organisms on the planet that were anaerobic, that did not need oxygen, that actually found oxygen poisonous. Now, but since we have oxygen, there's two interesting things that happened once that oxygen accumulated, other than causing this mass extinction event. Actually, three interesting things. Two of them are crucial to us eventually showing up on this planet. The first is that it became suitable now for eukaryotes to exist. Eukaryotic organisms, remember, these are organisms that have nuclear membranes around their DNA. Most eukaryotes have other organelles, like mitochondria. They need oxygen. You can go to the biology playlist. We actually talk about respiration that occurs in the mitochondria. And that's obviously a process that needs oxygen. So one, now that oxygen is in the atmosphere, we're starting to have an environment where eukaryotes could at least exist. And based on the fossil records, and when we look at how the DNA has changed over time, and we'll do multiple videos of that, we think that the first eukaryotes showed up about 2.2 billion years ago. Although there's some debate here. There's some evidence it might have been a little earlier, some evidence it might have been a little later. I'm sure that number will be refined. But about, give or take a few hundred millions of years, one prokaryote got engulfed by another prokaryote and said, hey, we do pretty well living together. The current theory is that mitochondria is actually descended from a kind of an ancient prokaryotic cell, an ancient bacteria. It actually has its own DNA. And actually, your mitochondrial DNA is passed down from your mother, and your mother's mother, and your mother's mother, so on and so forth. So it's kind of like another little animal living inside of a larger cell. And we are eukaryotes. We needed this to happen. The human body, we're not just one eukaryotic cell. We're made up of trillions. Estimates are 50 to 100 trillion eukaryotic cells. So this was a super, these are our ancestors that had to come into being at that time. And once again, all of this is happening inside of the oceans. Now the other interesting thing that happened. Remember, we're being bombarded with UV radiation from the sun. So if you're on the land, let me draw the land and the ocean. So here is the ocean, and then here is the land, right over there in yellow, constantly being bombarded with UV radiation. And UV stands for ultraviolet, so I'm drawing it in purple. But it's even more violet than purple. So it's constantly being bombarded with ultraviolet radiation from the sun, which is very inhospitable to DNA and to life. And so the only life at this point could occur in the ocean, where it was protected to some degree from the ultraviolet radiation. The land was just open to it. Anything on the land would have just gotten irradiated. Its DNA would get mutated. It just would not be able to live. So what happened, and what I guess has to happen, and the reason why we are able to live on land now is that we have an ozone layer. We have an ozone layer up in the upper atmosphere that helps absorb, that blocks most of the UV radiation from the sun. And now that oxygen began to accumulate, we have the oxygen catastrophe. Oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere. Some of that oxygen goes into the upper atmosphere. So we're now in this time period right over here. It goes into the upper atmosphere. It actually reacts with the UV light to turn into ozone, which then can help actually block the UV light. And I'll do another video maybe on the ozone oxygen cycle. So this oxygen production, it's crucial, one, to having an ozone layer so that eventually life can exist on the land. And it's also crucial because eukaryotic organisms need that oxygen. Now the third thing that happened, this is also a pretty significant event, we believe that that oxygen that started to accumulate in the atmosphere reacted with methane in the atmosphere. So it reacted with methane. And methane is a greenhouse gas. It helps retain heat in the atmosphere. And once it reacts with the oxygen and starts dropping out of the atmosphere as methane, we believe the Earth cooled down. And it entered its first, and some people believe, its longest snowball period. So that's what they talk about right here on this diagram. The first snowball Earth. It's sometimes called the Huronic glaciation. And that happened because we weren't able to retain our heat, if that theory is correct. And so as the theory goes, the whole Earth essentially just iced over. So as we go through the Proterozoic eon, I guess the big markers of it is it's the first time that we now have an oxygen-rich atmosphere. It's the first time that eukaryotes can now come into existence. Because they now have oxygen to, I guess we could say, breathe. And the other big thing is now this is where the ozone forms. So this kind of sets the stage in the next eon for animals or living things to eventually get onto the land. And we'll talk about that in the next video."
ef4bf48d-c2a3-4e97-acd3-6754905d8a40,"What I want to do in this video is kind of introduce you to the idea of, one, how carbon-14 comes about and how it gets into all living things, and then either later in this video or in future videos, we'll talk about how it's actually used to date things, how we use it to actually figure out that that bone is 12,000 years old, that that person died 18,000 years ago, whatever it might be. So let me draw the Earth. So let me just draw the surface of the Earth like that. It's just a little section of the surface of the Earth, and then we have the atmosphere of the Earth. I'll draw that in yellow. So then you have the Earth's atmosphere right over here. Let me write that down. Atmosphere. Atmosphere. And 78%, the most abundant element in our atmosphere is nitrogen. It is 78% nitrogen, and I'll write nitrogen. Its symbol is just N, and it has 7 protons, and it also has 7 neutrons. So it has an atomic mass of roughly 14, and this is the most typical isotope of nitrogen, and we talk about the word isotope in the chemistry playlist. An isotope, the protons define what element it is, but this number up here can change depending on the number of neutrons you have. So the different versions of a given element, those are each called isotopes. I just view them in my head as versions of an element. So anyway, we have our atmosphere, and then coming from our sun, we have what's commonly called cosmic rays, but they're actually not rays. They're cosmic particles. They're mainly, you can view them as just single protons, which is the same thing as a hydrogen nucleus. They can also be alpha particles, which is the same thing as a helium nucleus, and there's even a few electrons. They're going to come in, and they're going to bump into things in our atmosphere, and they're actually going to form neutrons. So they're actually going to form neutrons, and we'll show a neutron with a lowercase n and a 1 for its mass number, and we don't write anything because it has no protons down here. Like we had for nitrogen, we had 7 protons, so it's not really an element. It is a subatomic particle, but you have these neutrons form, and every now and then, and let's just be clear, this isn't like a typical reaction, but every now and then, one of those neutrons will bump into one of the nitrogen-14s in just the right way, so that it bumps off one of the protons in the nitrogen, and essentially replaces that proton with itself. So let me make it clear. So it bumps off one of the protons, so instead of 7 protons, we now have 6 protons, but this number 14 doesn't go down to 13 because it replaces it with itself, so this still stays at 14, and now since it only has 6 protons, this is no longer nitrogen. By definition, this is now carbon, and that proton that was bumped off just kind of gets emitted. So then, let me just do that in another color. So plus, and a proton that's just flying around, you could call that hydrogen-1, and it can gain an electron in some ways. If it doesn't gain an electron, it's just a hydrogen ion, a positive ion, either way, or a hydrogen nucleus. But this process, and once again, it's not a typical process, but it happens every now and then, this is how carbon-14 forms. So this right here is carbon-14. You can essentially view it as a nitrogen-14 where one of the protons is replaced with a neutron. And what's interesting about this is this is constantly being formed in our atmosphere, not in huge quantities, but in reasonable quantities. So let me write this down. Constantly being formed. Constant formation. And what happens is, and let me be very clear. Let's look at the periodic table over here. Typical carbon, so carbon by definition, if you have 6 protons, carbon by definition, it has 6 protons. But the typical isotope, the most common isotope of carbon, is carbon-12. So carbon-12 is the most common. So most of the carbon in your body is carbon-12. But what's interesting is that a small fraction of carbon-14 forms, and then this carbon-14 can then also combine with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. And then that carbon dioxide gets absorbed into the rest of the atmosphere, into our oceans. It can be fixed by plants. When people talk about carbon fixation, they're really talking about using mainly light energy from the sun to take gaseous carbon and turn it into actual kind of organic tissue. And so this carbon-14 makes its way. It's constantly being formed. It makes its way into oceans. It's already in the air, but it completely mixes through the whole atmosphere. Oceans and the air. And then it makes its way into plants. And then it makes its way into plants. They're really just made out of that fixed carbon, that carbon that was taken in gaseous form and put into, I guess you could say, into kind of a solid form, put it into a living form. That's what wood pretty much is. It gets put into plants, and then it gets put into the things that eat the plants. So that could be us. Now why is this even interesting? I've just explained a mechanism where some of our body, even though carbon-12 is the most common isotope, some of our body, while we're living, gets made up of this carbon-14 thing. Well, the interesting thing is the only time you can take in this carbon-14 is while you're alive, while you're eating new things. Because as soon as you die and you get buried under the ground, there's no way for the carbon-14 to become part of your tissue anymore because you're not eating anything with new carbon-14. And what's interesting here is once you die, you're not going to get any new carbon-14, and that carbon-14 that you did have at your death is going to decay via beta decay, and we learned about this, back into nitrogen-14. So this process reverses. So it'll decay back into nitrogen-14 and beta decay. You emit an electron and an electron antineutrino. I won't go into the details of that. But essentially what you have happening here is you have one of the neutrons is turning into a proton and emitting this stuff in the process. Now why is this interesting? So I just said while you're living, you have kind of straight-up carbon-14, and carbon-14 is constantly doing this decay thing. But what's interesting is as soon as you die and you're not ingesting any more plants or breathing from the atmosphere, if you are a plant, or fixing from the atmosphere, and this even applies to plants, once the plant dies, it's no longer taking in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turning it into new tissue. The carbon-14 in that tissue gets frozen, and this carbon-14 does this decay at a specific rate. And then you can use that rate to actually determine how long ago that thing must have died. So the rate at which this happens, so the rate of carbon-14 decay, is essentially half disappears, half gone in roughly 5,730 years. And this is actually called a half-life. And we talk about it in other videos. This is called a half-life. And I want to be clear here. You don't know which half of it's gone. It's a probabilistic thing. You can't just say, oh, all of the carbon-14s on the left are going to decay and all the carbon-14s on the right aren't going to decay in that 5,730 years. What it's essentially saying is any given carbon-14 atom has a 50% chance of decaying into nitrogen-14 in 5,730 years. So over the course of 5,730 years, roughly half of them will have decayed. Now why is that interesting? Well, if you know that all living things have a certain proportion of carbon-14 in their tissue as kind of part of what makes them up, and then if you were to find some bone, let's just say find some bone right here. You dig it up on some type of archaeology dig. And you say, hey, that bone has one-half the carbon-14 of all the living things that you see right now. So you could, it would be a pretty reasonable estimate to say, well, that thing must be 5,730 years old. Even better, maybe you dig a little deeper and you find another bone. Maybe you find another bone, maybe a couple of feet even deeper. And you say, wow, you know, this thing right over here has one-fourth the carbon-14. This has one-fourth the carbon-14 that I would expect to find in something living. So how old is this? Well, if it only has one-fourth the carbon-14, it must have gone through two half-lives. After one half-life, it would have one-half the carbon. And then after another half-life, half of that also turns into nitrogen-14. And so this would involve two half-lives, which is the same thing as 2 times 5,730 years. Or you would say that this thing is what? This thing is 10,000, you'd say this thing is 11,460 years old, give or take."
