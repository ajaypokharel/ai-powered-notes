c46a401b-3225-4216-a43a-acc2bddb4202,"As we begin our journey into the world of economics, I thought I would begin with a quote from one of the most famous economists of all times, the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith. And he really is kind of the first real economist in the way that we view it now. And this is from his The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, coincidentally, the same year as the American Declaration of Independence. And it's one of the most famous excerpts. He generally, indeed, he being an economic actor, neither intends to promote the public interest nor knows how much he is promoting it. By directing that industry, so the industry in control of that individual actor, in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain. He intends only his own gain. And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. And this term, invisible hand, is famous. Led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. He's saying, look, when individual actors just act in their own self-interest, that often an aggregate leads to things that each of those individual actors did not intend. And then he says, nor is it always the worst for society that it was no part of it. So it's not always necessarily a bad thing. By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. So this is a pretty strong statement. It's really at the core of capitalism. And that's why I point out that it was published the same year as the American Declaration of Independence because, obviously, America, the founding fathers, they wrote the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution. It really talks about what it means to be a democratic country. What are the rights of its citizens? But the United States, in its overall, the overall experience of an American is at least as influenced by the work of Adam Smith, by these kind of foundational ideas of capitalism. And they just both happened to happen around the same time. But this idea, it's not always that intuitive. Individual actors, by essentially pursuing their own self-interested ends, might be doing more for society than if any of them actually try to promote the overall well-being of society. And I don't think Adam Smith would say that it's always good for someone to act self-interested or that it's never good for people to actually think about the implications of what they're doing in an aggregate sense. But he's saying that frequently, frequently, this self-interested action could lead to the greater good, could lead to more innovation, could lead to better investment, could lead to more productivity, could lead to more wealth, more, a larger pie for everyone. And now economics is frequently, and when he makes a statement, he's actually making a mix of a microeconomic and a macroeconomic statement. Micro is that people, individual actors, are acting in their own self-interest. And the macro is that it might be good for the economy or for the nation as a whole. And so now, modern economists tend to divide themselves into these two schools or into these two subjects. Microeconomics, which is the study of individual actors. Microeconomics, and those actors could be firms, it could be people, it could be households. And you have macroeconomics, which is the study of the economy in aggregate. Macroeconomics. And you get it from their words. Micro, the prefix, refers to very small things. Macro refers to the larger, the bigger picture. And so microeconomics, just to restate it, is essentially how actors make decisions, or I guess we could say allocations, allocations, decisions slash allocations, allocations of scarce resources. And you're gonna hear the word scarce resources a lot when people talk about economics. And a scarce resource is one that you don't have an infinite amount of. For example, love might not be a scarce resource. You might have an infinite amount of love. But a resource that would be scarce is something like food or water or money or time or labor. These are all scarce resources. And so microeconomics is, well, how do people decide where to put those scarce resources? How do they decide where to deploy them? And how does that affect prices and markets and whatever else? Macroeconomics is a study of what happens in aggregate to an economy. So aggregate, what happens in aggregate to an economy from the millions of individual actors? Aggregate, aggregate economy. We now have millions, millions of actors. And it often focuses on policy-related questions. So do you raise or lower taxes? Or what's going to happen when you raise or lower taxes? Do you regulate or deregulate? How does that affect the overall productivity when you do these? So it's policy, top, top-down, top-down questions. And in both macro and microeconomics, especially in the modern sense of it, there's an attempt to make them rigorous, to make them mathematical. So in either case, you can start with some of the ideas, some of the philosophical ideas or the logical ideas that, say, someone like an Adam Smith might have. So you have these, and there are basic ideas about how people think, how people make decisions. So philosophy of people of decision-making, in the case of microeconomics, decision-making. And then you make some assumptions about it, or you simplify it. So I'll do the right, this. You simplify it. And you really are simplifying. You say, oh, all people are rational, or all people are gonna act in their own self-interest, or all people are going to maximize their gain, which isn't true. Human beings are motivated by a whole bunch of things. But you simplify these things so that you can start to deal with it in kind of a mathematical way. So you simplify it so you can start dealing with it in a mathematical sense. And this is valuable. It can clarify your thinking. It can allow you to prove things based on your assumptions. And you can start to visualize things mathematically with charts and graphs, and think about what will actually happen with the markets. So it's very, very valuable to have this mathematical rigorous thinking. But at the same time, it can be a little bit dangerous because you're making these huge simplifications. And sometimes the math might lead you to some very strong conclusions, conclusions which you might feel very strongly about because it looks like you've proven them the same way that you might prove relativity, but they were based on some assumptions that either might be wrong or might be oversimplifications or might not be relevant to the context that you're trying to make conclusions about. So it's very, very, very important to take it all with a grain of salt, to remember that it's all based on some simplifying assumptions. And macroeconomics is probably even more guilty of it. In microeconomics, you're taking these deeply complicated things, the human brain, how people act and respond to each other, and then you're aggregating it over millions of people. So it's ultra complicated. You have millions of these infinitely complicated people all interacting with each other. So it's very complicated. Many millions of interactions and fundamentally unpredictable interactions, and then trying to make assumptions on those, trying to make assumptions, and then doing math with that that could lead you to some conclusions or might lead you to some predictions. And once again, it's very important. This is valuable. It's valuable to make these mathematical models, to make these mathematical assumptions, these mathematical conclusions, but it always needs to be taken with a grain of salt. And so that you have a proper grain of salt and so that you are always focused on the true intuition, and that's really the most important thing to get from a course of economics so that you can truly reason through what's likely to happen, maybe even without the mathematics. I'll leave you with two quotes. And these quotes are a little bit, they're a little bit funny, but they really, I think, are helpful things to keep in mind as you start to especially go deep into the mathematical side of economics. So this right over here is a quote by Alfred Knopf, who was a publisher in the 1900s. An economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible. And I'm assuming when he's talking about the incomprehensible, he's referring to some of the mathy stuff that you see in economics. And hopefully we'll make this as comprehensible as possible and see that there is value in this. But it's a very important statement he's making. Oftentimes it's stating a common sense thing. It's stating something that's obvious. It's obvious, and it's very important to always keep that in mind, to always make sure that you have the intuition for what's happening in the math, or to know when the math is going in a direction that might be strange based on oversimplifications or wrong assumptions. And then you have this quote over here by Lawrence J. Peter, most famous for Peter's Principles, professor at USC. An economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn't happen today. And once again, important to keep in the back of one's mind because especially, and this is especially relevant to macroeconomics, because in macroeconomics, there's all sorts of predictions about the state of the economy, what needs to be done, how long will the recession last, what will be the economic growth next year, what will inflation do? And they often prove to be wrong. In fact, few economists even tend to agree on many of these things. And it's very important to realize that because oftentimes, when you're deep in the mathematics of the economics, it might seem to be a science like physics, but it's not a science like physics. There's open, it is open to subjectivity, and a lot of that subjectivity is all around, is all around the assumptions that you choose to make."
012830b5-8073-4bd5-9419-4fc10ab83756,"Consciousness is perhaps the biggest riddle in nature. Stripped to its core meaning, consciousness is what allows us to be aware both of our surroundings and of our own inner state. But thinking about consciousness has this habit of taking us round in circles. We all intuitively know what consciousness is. It's this. It's what you're experiencing here, right now. But once we try to pinpoint just what exactly it is, it leaves us grasping at thin air. And not just us. Philosophers and scientists struggle to define consciousness. Different schools and ideas compete with one another, but no one has come close to figuring it out. It's unsettling to realize that we don't understand what makes us aware of ourselves and the world. In this fuzzy area, consciousness and intelligence are also related, although they are not the same. We'll talk in greater depth about theories of consciousness and intelligence in other videos. Like much of what makes us human, our consciousness is likely to have evolved from less complex forms as a product of evolution by natural selection. It has probably emerged from an immense, several hundred million year sequence of countless microsteps that together make up a sort of gradient of consciousness. What was the first step on this path from the non-conscious to the basic consciousness that ultimately led to the convoluted consciousness we humans enjoy today? Take a stone. The consensus is that a stone is not conscious, though not everyone agrees even on this. Some panpsychists claim that a lump of rock may have an inner life. However, there are no real grounds for any such assumption, since stones never show behavior. Their inner life can neither be proven nor disproven. A more common starting point is with living things. A living thing, or a self, is a part of the universe that sustains itself and makes more of its kind. To do so, it needs energy. And this is where an awareness of the world comes in handy. The original function of consciousness was probably to direct a mobile self that was short of energy to a fresh supply of food. On the smaller scales of life, you don't need to be aware to find food. Trichoplax adherens, one of the simplest of all animals, moves around haphazardly. It slows down in the presence of food and speeds up in its absence. This is highly effective and makes the tiny creature spend more time where there is food than where there is not. But it never moves in a particular direction towards a particular target, and there's no need for it to be conscious of its environment. The first major step towards consciousness was probably taken when mobile selves started to move themselves directionally, moving towards what was good for them, say food, and away from what was less good, say someone else who thought that they were food. Take Dogicia tigrina, a tiny worm known for its funny face. Sometimes the worm is hungry and sometimes not. This means that when it moves, the worm self is not simply producing an automatic response to an external stimulus, but that its actions depend upon its inner physiological state, whether it's hungry or sated. When it's just eaten, the worm is less energetic, but when starved for a while, it will move itself in the direction of tasty things. It uses chemoreceptors on its head to smell its environment and guide it in the direction where the scent of food is strongest. After finding and eating a meal, our worm buddy heads back to a dark, sheltered spot to digest it in safety, until it's hungry again. But animals that blindly follow their sense of smell don't have a concrete objective in view. They still lack any sense of where they are heading. So the next step on the ladder of consciousness is to add some perception at a distance, like vision. Vision adds context and depth to our world. With vision comes a sense of the space we and our food exist in. It adds a whole new dimension to awareness and is a huge step towards more familiar consciousness. An optical apparatus like an eye enables us to visualize our goal and lock onto it. But even at this stage, a self is only able to pursue its food as long as it sees it. So the next logical step needs to happen on the inside. To visualize food in its absence, for example, a self needs to create some sort of inner representation of the world. Now an animal can continue looking for food, even when it escapes its sensory range. Because of this inner representation of what is relevant in the world, it can remain focused on its food and its desire to get it. Our self now exists in a world it can get familiar with. The ability to remember things has emerged. Thanks to memory, animals can be distracted from a pursuit for a few seconds, but quickly continue their path afterwards. A related phenomenon is called object permanence. This describes our awareness that things continue to exist even when we can't see them. This cognitive skill is enjoyed by some mammals and birds, and perhaps other animals too. Human babies tend to develop this ability around the time they turn eight months, while baby chickens show this ability within a day or two of being born. The capacity to remember a thing in its absence suggests at least a basic sense of time. A sense of time is a big step on the ladder of consciousness. It may also enable a self to look forward from the present moment and anticipate the future. Adult chickens, for example, are able to resist a meal put in front of them if they expect to receive a bigger meal as a prize for holding back for a while. This sort of delayed gratification means there is an ability to visualize a reward that only exists in the future, which can be quite a challenge even for adult humans. Western scrub jays are experts in delayed gratification. They show an even more elaborate sense of the future when they hide food in a cache to retrieve it at a later date. The scrub jays will even re-hide their food if they become aware that a potential thief has been watching them. This means that they know that there are other hungry selves out there who are aware and see the world from their own, different perspective. Crafty scrub jays can sort of read the mind of their fellow birds. This ability to mind-read is crucial for complex levels of consciousness. By putting yourself in the position of others, you can outsmart a rich competitor or empathize with a hungry friend. Language takes the ability to read minds and represent what is absent to a whole new level. Words enable us to construct hypotheses about the world, make detailed plans and to communicate them with others. Words enable us to think about ourselves and our place in the universe, and even about our own consciousness, which is something we'll be doing more in future videos. So what is the origin of our consciousness? It probably began as the directed motion of a hungry self towards a source of food, with the survival benefits this gave it over competitors that moved at random or not at all. It probably all started with the urge for more food. So even with the sophisticated consciousness that allows us to dream about space, build skyscrapers or obsess about novels, it's not surprising that we can't stop thinking about where we'll get our next meal. Collectively, we've put so much thought and ingenuity into getting food that we can now just get our food to come to us with little conscious effort.

5d65c158-bf3c-4cbd-9228-e70432a73e92,"The goal of this video is to appreciate how ideas of natural rights and social contract and limited government and popular sovereignty are embedded in America's founding documents. But before we start looking at the documents themselves, let's just make sure we understand the context in which they were written. As we enter into the mid-1770s, you have the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, which begins in 1775. A little more than a year after the beginning of the war, you have the Second Continental Congress decide to formally declare independence on July 2nd, and the Declaration of Independence, which we will study a bit in this video, is formally approved on July 4th, 1776, which is when we now celebrate Independence Day, even though some could argue that it was July 2nd. Now, as soon as the colonies decide that they are independent from the Kingdom of Great Britain, they have to think about how do we govern ourselves. And so within roughly a week, a little more than a week, after the Declaration of Independence is approved, they start drafting the Articles of Confederation. Remember, the Revolutionary War is still going on. Eventually, what will be known as the Articles of Confederation go into effect in 1781. Now, this Articles of Confederation really treat the various colonies as you could almost view it as separate states that agree to work together for purposes of getting independence from Great Britain, for purposes of fighting the war, for purposes of diplomacy. Now, over the course of the next several years, it becomes clear, especially through things like Shay's Rebellion, which we will look at in other videos, that the Articles of Confederation don't provide a strong enough central government. And so in May 1787, you have what is called as the Constitutional Convention convening. It's presided over by George Washington, who led the Americans in the Revolutionary War, which they eventually will win, as you see, and obviously we're an independent country now. And the original intent of the Constitutional Convention was to revise the Articles of Confederation. But folks like Madison and Hamilton were really intent on just completely replacing it. And what they replaced it with was what is now the U.S. Constitution, which goes into effect in March of 1789. And shortly thereafter, you have the beginning of Washington's two terms. And to be clear, the idea of even having a powerful executive, the idea of even having a president, was not present in the Articles of Confederation. That comes with the Constitution. So with that context out of the way, let's look at especially the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. So here's the beginning of the Declaration of Independence, written by Jefferson and edited by Benjamin Franklin and John Adams. And I encourage you to pause this video and first try to read it on your own and see if you can identify these ideas of natural rights, limited government, popular sovereignty, republicanism, and social contract. Okay, let's read this together now. When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with another. Remember, this is a Declaration of Independence. They are dissolving the political bonds with the kingdom of Great Britain. And to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them. So that's starting to refer a little bit to natural rights. A decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. So they're saying, hey, we're writing this document because we're trying to show the rest of mankind why the reasons for which we are deciding to declare our independence from Great Britain. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. Let me underline this. That all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. So this is a direct reference to natural rights. In fact, the phrase life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, most historians believe is in direct reference to John Locke's phrase life, liberty, and property when he talks about natural rights. So this is direct reference to the Enlightenment ideas or even the pre-Enlightenment ideas of natural rights. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. All right, this is worth underlining as well because they're talking about governments being instituted among men to secure these rights. This is all about social contract. So that's social contract. That we form a government in order to secure rights. We might give it some rights, but in exchange, the government has to protect our rights. And they derive their powers from the consent of the governed. So let me write that. Let me underline that actually in a different color. Derive their powers from the consent of the governed. That is popular sovereignty. Popular, I'll just write it as pop-sov. Popular sovereignty right over here. That the people are the sovereigns. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute a new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness. So this is more about social contract. They're like, look, if a government breaks its social contract, we have a right to replace it. And the document also makes reference to organizing its powers in such form. So that's really talking about limited government. They're talking about, hey, this government just won't have the absolute right to do anything. So that right over there is limited government. Prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes. They're essentially saying, look, you shouldn't just overthrow your government on a whim. And accordingly, all experience have shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. So they're saying, look, if you're prudent, you wouldn't just overthrow your government on a whim. But they're kind of saying we're not so worried about that because history has shown us, experience has shown us that if anything, people are more likely to keep suffering even when they should be overthrowing their government. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security. So they're saying, hey, look, the Kingdom of Great Britain, they are abusing us. They are usurping power. Usurping is taking something from you that is yours. And so we need to throw off such a government for our own future security. And here it says provide new guards for their future security. So this provide new guards, once again, making reference to limited government."
deb7aa2d-f08f-4cce-ba82-4cc6b38a831b,"What we're going to do in this video is discuss some of the foundational ideas for the United States of America. And we could start at the most foundational of ideas, and that's the notion of natural rights. John Locke, one of the significant Enlightenment thinkers, describes rights like life, liberty, and you might expect me to say pursuit of happiness, which is what we see in the Declaration of Independence, but John Locke refers to life, liberty, and property. But even though his version is a little bit different than what ends up in the Declaration of Independence, most historians believe that Thomas Jefferson was heavily influenced by John Locke's idea of natural rights when Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence. And the idea here is that these are rights that people should be born with, that should never be taken away from them. And in the video on social contract, we talk about the idea of why someone would form a government. They would form a government, they would give some rights to a government in order to protect these basic rights, things like life, liberty, property, the pursuit of happiness. And so you might have some other rights that one would say in a state of nature people might have, the right to do physical harm on others, the right to imprison others, the right to tax others. But in a social contract, we decide, hey, instead of everyone trying to figure out things on their own, let's give these rights to a government. And in exchange, the government should protect, should protect all of these rights for the individuals. And once again, this is review from the social contract video. This is a notion of a social contract. Now the next question is, all right, so if we are willing to engage in this social contract with a government, what type of a government should it be? And throughout most of human history, governments have been things like monarchies, where you have a single individual, maybe a king or queen, an emperor, some type of a conqueror, who is the sovereign, who rules over the state. But you could have, you could, instead of having one, you could have a small group, which would be an oligarchy. Or you could go to the other extreme, where the people are sovereign. And the word for that, and this is a key idea for the United States, is popular, popular sovereignty. The people are sovereign. The government is accountable to the people. Sometimes this could be referred to as democracy. Now the founding fathers of the United States were a little bit suspicious of pure democracy, or direct popular sovereignty. They were afraid that if you start having factions and a majority faction were to come to power, if you have a straight democracy, then they might use that power to strip some of the natural rights of, say, their political enemies or people that they just don't agree with. And so you have this other idea of limited government. Limited government. And some of the key things that limit the government, you could just say generally the rule of law, things like the Constitution, including how the government is structured, the checks and balances in it, the Bill of Rights, clearly is a check on government. And you don't just have limited government when you have a democracy. You could have a limited government even in a monarchy. The United Kingdom is officially a constitutional monarchy where you have a monarch who's sovereign, has very limited powers, because of things like the rule of law. Now the last idea that we're going to talk about in this video is the notion of a republic, or the idea of republicanism. Because the founding fathers didn't actually like calling the United States a democracy. Instead, they favored calling it a republic. And the word republic can mean different things to different people today, depending on what context you use. To some folks today, it means any form of government that's not a monarchy. To other folks, it means, okay, you have a democracy, you have popular sovereignty, but you have limited government. You still have rights that protect minorities, rights that make sure that even if people are not in the majority, they are protected. To the founding fathers, they had a version of this notion of republic. They did view a republic as something that would prevent the passions of an unfettered, pure democracy. But they thought it came mainly by having a representative democracy. That if you had a smaller group of elected representatives, as opposed to everyone getting involved in every issue, that they could calm the passions of the crowds, so to speak. They also thought it was logistically more practical. Sure, ancient Athens could have something closer to a pure democracy, but that was just a small city-state. Well, here, even the 13 colonies were significantly more vast, and obviously, the United States would become even more vast than that. And to appreciate this notion of a republic, right over here is a quote from James Madison in The Federalist Papers number 10. And just for some context on what The Federalist Papers even were, as we mentioned, shortly after the Declaration of Independence, the founding fathers start drafting the Articles of Confederation. They go into effect in 1781. But this is really a loose confederation of states that each individually think of themselves as sovereign states. And it's really a pact that they'll engage in war together, diplomacy together, free trade. But you have Shay's Rebellion, and it's very clear, and we'll talk about this in other videos, that the Articles of Confederation are not powerful enough. And so you have a constitutional convention in mid-1787 in which James Madison is a central figure. Some people discuss him as the father of the U.S. Constitution. They draft what is today the Constitution, but then they have to sell it to the states in order for it to be ratified. Alexander Hamilton has the idea of, hey, why don't we publish a series of papers? And they eventually publish 85 papers, which will collectively be known as The Federalist Papers. And Hamilton writes most of them, but he also recruits James Madison and John Jay. And Federalist Papers Number 10, which is perhaps the most famous, is James Madison's discussion of how do you avoid factions taking over the government and doing things that are not in the interest of the people? And I encourage you to read all of Federalist Papers Number 10, but I have a very small quote here. And this is James Madison's notion of what a republic was, and he thought the United States should be a republic. The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic are, first, the delegation of government in the latter, so he's talking about a republic, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest. So he's really talking about representative democracy, but he thought this was a key component of being a republic. Secondly, the greater number of citizens and greater sphere of country over which the latter may be extended, that only through a representative government could you actually govern over 13 colonies or even beyond 13 colonies. And that's why today, obviously, you might have had something closer to a pure democracy in ancient Athens, which was a city-state, but today, almost any democracy is some form of representative democracy, which James Madison would consider to be a republic. But if you wanted to classify the United States today, a fair term might be it is a democratic republic. You definitely have popular sovereignty. The people are considered sovereign, but they don't rule directly. They rule through representatives, which, by Madison's definition, would make it a republic. So now that you're armed with some of these basic ideas, I encourage you to engage even more with some of the founding documents for the United States. And on top of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, I encourage you to read as many of the Federalist Papers as possible, because it's really an explanation of the ideas behind the U.S. Constitution. And you should start with Federalist Papers number 10. As you'll see, James Madison is quite insightful. He predicts how factions might form, how parties might form, and not always do things in the interest of its people. But I'll leave you to decide whether he was right, whether forming a republic helps this notion of factionalism and look at the world that we are in today and think about whether James Madison would be happy or maybe he would be a little bit uncertain about how things turned out."
94dbdeee-f199-4143-9a40-eb0e3b26ca8f,"Here's the riddle, my hobbitses. What's something that we all experience all the time, that we can't really measure, and barely have words to define? You can't hold it in your hand or take a bite out of it. It isn't something you learn or practice. It just is. Consciousness. Every science has certain concepts that are so fundamental, yet abstract, that we have a hard time finding the appropriate words to describe them. Ask a physicist, and they'll tell you energy and space defy simple definitions. Biologists know if something is alive, but have a harder time explaining what life actually is. Ask a psychologist what consciousness is, and you'll get… you'll get a slippery answer. For the purposes of this conversation, we're going to actually loosely define consciousness, as our awareness of ourselves and our environment. It's this awareness that allows us to take in and organize information from many sources and senses at once. American psychologist William James thought of consciousness as a continuously moving, shifting, and unbroken stream, hence the term stream of consciousness. Others think of it as the brain's roving flashlight, shining down an unbroken beam of light that highlights one thing, then moves to the next. The point is, your conscious experience is forever shifting. For example, right now, hopefully, you're focused on the words coming out of my mouth. But with a little shift, your mind might wander to how you really should probably shower today, and your chair's kinda uncomfortable, and you suddenly have to pee, and can you believe what Bernice said? Do I spell pizza? Hey, eyes here. We're learning. Beyond that moment-to-moment shifting, consciousness allows us to contemplate life, think about infinity, and ride a unicycle across a tightrope while juggling melons, at least in theory. Our consciousness helps us plan our futures, consider consequences, and reflect on the past. It is both the most familiar and the most mysterious part of our lives. Kinda like The Force, but for the little universes inside our heads. Intro Throughout our daily lives, we flip back and forth between various states of consciousness, including waking, sleeping, and various altered states. These can occur spontaneously, like dreaming, or be physiologically sparked, like a drug-induced hallucination, or be triggered psychologically, through meditation or hypnosis, for example. We're gonna take the next three episodes to look closely at these different states of consciousness, but let's start with what it really means to be awake. For centuries, scientists learned what they could about the brain solely through clinical observation. And they learned a lot, for sure. But with today's technology, we're actually able to see some of the structures and activity inside a living, working brain, its electrical, metabolic, and magnetic signatures displayed on screens for our wonder and amusement. The field of cognitive neuroscience is the study of how brain activity is linked with our mental processes, including thinking, perception, memory, and language. Like other kinds of neuroscience, it uses neuroimaging technologies to consider links between specific brain states and conscious experiences. And there's more than one way to scan a brain. Structural imaging shows the brain's anatomy, and is useful in identifying large-scale tumors, diseases, and injuries. In contrast, functional imaging shows us electromagnetic or metabolic activity in the brain, like blood to let us observe correlations between specific mental functions and activity in particular brain areas. So, yes, neuroimaging has been revolutionizing the field of psychology, much like telescopes and microscopes did for astronomy and biology. But on the other hand, some of this technology is very new, and there's plenty of disagreement about how to interpret neuroimaging findings. Remember, correlation does not equal causation, so activity in a certain brain region while having certain kinds of thoughts might be useful to know, but it's not the end of the conversation. We've already talked a lot about how function is often localized in the brain, and how everything psychological is simultaneously biological, so it stands to reason our thoughts and emotions could in part be illustrated by a bright flare on a dark screen. We've also collected a fair amount of evidence that we don't just have one layer of consciousness – a single tape playing various tunes – but rather something more like two layers, each supported by its own personal bio-psycho-social pit crew. I'm talking about one of the dual-process models of consciousness. The idea that our conscious, deliberate mind could be saying, look, a squirrel, while our implicit, automatic mind is simultaneously sub-processing, like a computer – color, brown, tail, bushy, movement, climbing, distance, 20 meters, association, my sister had a squirrel phobia as a child. Implicit bias – I think that squirrels are ruining America, all of which might weigh upon my behavior upon seeing the little guy. By some estimates, all your different senses are scooping up nearly 11 million bits of information every second, and yet, you consciously register only about 40 at a time. So how do we keep focused, and filter out all that chatter, to actually get stuff done? With selective attention, of course! Selective attention is how we focus our consciousness on one particular stimulus or group of stimuli, effectively tuning out the rest. Your consciousness is like a spotlight on a busy stage. There are other things going on around you that your automatic, sub-processor brain is covertly registering, but for those moments when you shine your spotlight, most of the other stimuli fall away. Try it at home! Right now, you're consciously watching this lesson on consciousness. You probably don't notice the feel of your socks on your feet, or the tongue that's inside your mouth, always filling up your mouth with tongue. But as soon as I mention it, and the spotlight of your attention turns to them, you feel those socks on your feet, and you're like, wow, it's weird that there's a tongue in my mouth. The classic auditory example of selective attention is the cocktail party effect. You could be in a room with 47 people jabbering away, and yet be able to concentrate your hearing on one conversation, tuning out the rest of the voices and the background music. But if the couple next to you were to speak your name, suddenly, your cognitive radar would light up, and your attention would whip around to the sound of your name, probably trying to figure out if Bernice was talking behind your back again. Bernice! This groving spotlight of selective attention is pretty handy most of the time, for spies and laypeople alike, but it can also be dangerous if you're being dumb and, say, texting and driving. When you shift your primary selective attention from driving to OMG LOLOLOLOLOL, you also unwittingly activate your selective inattention. Which means that you failed to see that cyclist, who you almost ran over, which would not only have ruined her life, but also yours. So don't text and drive! In fact, when your full attention is directed elsewhere, you'd be astounded by the scope of obvious things you failed to notice. It's called inattentional blindness. You may have even already been subject to one of the most famous experiments of inattentional blindness, the invisible gorilla, or sometimes the moonwalking bear. Just Google either of those things if you want to be tested on your awareness, and then come back. Pretty great, right? Given the prompt to count the number of passes one team makes, your consciousness is focused on following the players and the ball, nothing else. You don't see the players in black, they're the distraction. Also, you certainly don't see the dancing gorilla, or bear, whichever one. The original version of this experiment found that about 50% of people didn't notice there was a gorilla walking through the room. That's how powerfully selective our attention can be, something to remember next time you're behind the wheel. But do you know who understands and exploits inattentional blindness better than anyone? Magicians. Except they call it misdirection. The famous modern magician Teller of Penn and Teller says, every time you perform a magic trick, you're engaging in experimental psychology. And we can't help but be the rubes. Magicians also prey on our change blindness, the psychological phenomenon in which we fail to notice changes in our environment. And no, I don't mean climate change, I mean the failure to recognize the difference between what was there a moment ago versus what is there now. For example, I have changed shirts several times since this lesson started. In a well-known and often copied experiment, sometimes called the person swap, an experimenter will stop someone in the park, ask for directions, and then during some staged interruption, the original experimenter will leave and be replaced with a totally different person. Half the time, the subject doesn't even notice. Fun! One of the many perks of studying psychology with me is you learn all kinds of new ways to mess with people. But while change blindness makes for some really cool parlor tricks, this failure to notice certain things can be dangerous. Say, when faulty memories lead to false eyewitness testimonies in court, or when friends get deadlocked in a he-said-she-said disagreement. So my friends, use the Force, but use it wisely. As one of my favorite psychologists once advised, a Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack. Actually, that was Yoda. Anyway, the bottom line is, we are far less aware of what's going on around us than we think we are. And that's just when we're awake. Imagine what might slip your notice when you're half-asleep, or drunk, or hypnotized, or hallucinating. That's what we're going to talk about next time. Thanks for watching this episode of Crash Course. If you were selectively conscious of my words, you got introduced to our constant struggle to define consciousness, learned a little bit about neuroimaging and its developing role in psychological science, how our consciousness is split into two pieces deliberate and automatic, and how the brain can be selectively attentive, selectively inattentive, and blind to changes in some surprisingly major ways.

ec95237e-0158-4269-bfd8-8c23dc510596,"The entire field of economics is based on the idea of scarcity, and arguably, we wouldn't even need a field of economics if there wasn't the notion of scarcity in the world. So what does scarcity mean? Well, think about it. What does it mean in everyday life? It means that there's not enough of something to go around. If we're talking about scarce goods, scarce services, scarce resources, we're talking about things where if there was no cost associated with them, people would use far more of that than there actually is around. And in this video, we're gonna think about different types of goods and services, or just resources, and think about whether they are scarce or not. So a related idea to scarce resources is its opposite, which is the notion of a free resource. So this is something that you could argue is infinitely abundant, or at least in a certain context, is so abundant that it feels like people can have as much of it as they want. The more that one person has of it, it doesn't take away from someone else. And the reason why scarcity is essential to economics is because economics is the study of how do you allocate these scarce resources. If there's more demand for it than the amount of thing that there is, well, who gets it? How much of it do they get? And what do they have to give up in exchange to get those scarce resources? But for the sake of this video, let's just first make sure we understand and have a good idea of what resources are scarce and which ones aren't and why. So this is a picture of caviar, which is essentially fish eggs. And it's not easy to get. The fish eggs are deep in the water. Someone has to get to them, and then they have to package it in some way, and they have to get it to your plate. And so do you think that caviar is a scarce resource or a free resource? Well, if it was a free resource, that means that we're just swimming in caviar, that it's so abundant that I could just have as much caviar as I want, and there's still as much as you want, and that everyone gets as much caviar as they like. Well, that's clearly not the case. Caviar is a scarce resource. In fact, it is a quite scarce resource. And because of that, if you want it, you have to give up a good bit to get it. This is a picture of some people working in a factory. And the resource that jumps out here is that of labor. And labor's interesting because it's not as tangible as something like caviar, but it is a resource. And one could even argue that the caviar on your plate, some of its scarcity comes from the labor involved of getting it to your plate. But here, these are clearly, it looks like these are gentlemen who are putting together some type of fabric. And so would you consider labor, would you consider that a scarce resource or a free resource? Well, it would be a free resource if people were willing to just do as much work for other people, actually willing to do an infinite amount of work for other people, which isn't even humanly possible. And even if it was humanly possible, people aren't willing to do that. They want something in return. And so once again, it is a scarce resource. There's many resources that are pictured right here. You have this beautiful town next to this alpine lake. And so some clear scarce resources are here. Many people would love to have a view like you would get from this house or hotel right over here, but not everyone, and many people would love to live there because of the view, but not everyone can live there. So that is a scarce resource. The water here is an interesting one. I could imagine in earlier times, if before there was a town here, if there was just a primitive village living next to this fresh water, they would probably view it as a free resource. If someone was thirsty, they would just go up to the lake and they would just drink from the lake. They would not have to give up anything to drink from that. But now the town, it might be a little bit more of a scarce resource. They might wanna preserve it for various reasons. In order to get the water to your sink in your house, there might be some services or goods or labor involved. Someone has to set up the pipes. Maybe it has to be cleaned in some way. Well, then it might become a little bit more of a scarce resource. Air, for most of human history, has been considered a free resource. And even today, I'd argue that something like oxygen, at least on our planet, is considered a free resource. When I take a deep breath, it does not affect your ability to take a deep breath. It does not take oxygen away from you. Now, is there an infinite amount of oxygen in our atmosphere? No, but for our purposes, it feels like there's an infinite amount. Now, if the photosynthetic plants were to disappear and all of a sudden the oxygen started to get diminished, or if we were in a space station where there isn't a seemingly infinite amount of oxygen, well, then you could imagine a world where it could become a scarce resource. You could imagine a colony on the moon or on Mars or in the space station where it had some type of economic system to decide who gets how much oxygen. So I will leave you there. As already mentioned, scarcity is the central idea in all of economics. It's the reason why we even need a field called economics. And as you go forward in your study of both micro and macroeconomics, we'll be looking at ways to allocate these scarce resources. We'll try to study what people have to give up in order to have access to these resources. And we will have models that will help us understand what are the implications for these different methods of allocating resources."
1d7b0621-ce2f-476f-b22e-10fa166c4b01,"What we're going to do in this video is dig a little bit deeper into the notion of democracy. And the reason why this is going to be valuable is it's going to inform the decisions that the founding fathers had to make when they thought about whether to ratify the Constitution. It'll also inform our thoughts on government as it is today in the United States. What flavor of democracy does it take on, especially at different layers of government? So just as a review, and this is something that we have talked about in other videos, democracy comes from Greek, from rule by the people. Demo from demos, which is referring to people. And krasi coming from kratia, which is referring to rule. So rule by the people. Now broadly speaking, we can think of three general flavors of democracy. The first we can consider to be participatory, participatory democracy. The second we can call pluralist democracy. And I'll define these in a second. And then the third, let's call that elite democracy. Elite democracy. Now what do you think participatory democracy means based on the word participatory? Yes, as you might have guessed, it implies broad participation of the population. Broad participation. What are examples of a participatory democracy? Well, imagine a small town that has maybe a few hundred or a few thousand people. And if there's an issue of whether to build a stoplight at an intersection or change some of the zoning laws, you can imagine a large chunk of the town showing up to weigh in on that decision. Now what are some of the benefits of a participatory democracy and what are some of the negatives? Well, the benefits are, and I'll do those as pluses, a benefit is, well, it kind of seems closest to the original spirit of a democracy. It's coming out of ancient Greece, ancient Athens, the birthplace of democracy, where you did have residents go together and debate the major issues. Although even in ancient Athens, you have to take participation with a grain of salt because it wasn't everyone who was participating. It was, for the most part, wealthy men who had the time to actually sit and debate these issues. But if we wanna give a participatory democracy its credit, say in a small town, is that you really are representing the views of the people. Representing the people well. The people are directly involved. Now what are maybe some of the negatives? Well, it can get logistically difficult. We talked about a small town, but what if the town gets a little bit bigger? Or what if we're dealing with a state or we're dealing with a country where we're talking about tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions or tens of millions of people? How do you get all of those people to weigh in on an issue, even logistically? How do they get informed about it? And are they even prepared to weigh in on those issues? Sure, if you're in a town, you can think about whether an intersection should be there or whether they should put a stoplight there. But if we're talking about matters of national or international importance, influencing hundreds of millions of people, can you depend on people to be informed about the intricacies of the banking system or the military or foreign policy? And so this is really a question of does this scale? And there really aren't any good examples in history of direct democracy scaling in significant ways beyond fairly small groups of people. In the United States, the biggest scale where you might see this are in things like ballot measures at the city or the state level where people are directly voting on certain measures or certain laws. But even there, it's a limited scope for what the people will actually weigh in on. Now, the next category that we talk about is a pluralist democracy. Pluralism is referring to the idea of many different parties, same root as the word plural. You have many things. So you have many different parties and many different competing interests that are going to have a vigorous debate with each other on deciding what are the best ideas. And what are examples of pluralist democracies? If you think about the United States, there are many different interest groups. You could think about all of the different lobbyists, all of the different groups that represent different types of people trying to convince members of Congress either at the national level or even at the state level that their interest is right. Even within Congress, even though you have two major parties, you can have different factions that are really trying to argue it out. Now, what are the benefits of a pluralist democracy? Well, you can imagine that because there's this vigorous debate, maybe the good ideas surface. Good ideas surface. You don't have domination by just one party. No one group, one group or a small group of people, domination. But then on the other side of it, maybe there are some negatives. What might those be? Well, maybe all of this debate and argument is very inefficient. Maybe it takes a, maybe it's slow decision-making. Slow decisions. Or an extreme, no decisions. Some things like gridlock because people can't agree to things that in order for anything to get done, you have to make too many people happy and they all have their interests. Maybe the opposite of good ideas surface. Maybe good ideas die because it's very hard to make everyone happy. Now, the last category that we're gonna talk about is the idea of an elite democracy. And this is where you have more limited participation. So in some ways, it's almost the opposite of a participatory democracy. So this is limited, limited participation. And even though I gave ancient Athens as an example of a participatory democracy, it really was more of an elite democracy where the people had the time and the influence and the money. Those were the ones who were really weighing in on the issues of ancient Athens. And if you were to go to the Roman Republic, the Roman senators, these were, once again, elite men. So what would you think are benefits of an elite democracy? Well, one might be that these elites, so to speak, maybe they are more educated than the general public. And so that allows them to make more informed decisions, especially on things that are quite complex. It would be hard for everyone to weigh in on. If you're gonna change a new accounting standard or think about how do you regulate the telecommunications industry or some very sophisticated trade negotiation or foreign policy negotiation that education might help. And maybe it's also more decisive than either one of the pluralist or the participatory. The participatory, they might be able to appeal to maybe baser instincts, just people's passions, while the pluralists, since you have all of these groups competing, even if something makes sense, they might not be able to make that decision. But if you have a smaller, more limited group, limited participation, maybe they can make these decisions a little bit clearer. But what are the negatives here? Well, the clearest negative is, well, maybe this goes against the whole idea of a democracy. If it's all about the elites, maybe they do a good job at truly representing the interests of the people, but maybe they are good at representing the interests of the elite. So do they really represent the people? Is this a democracy where the people are sovereign, where the people rule? Or is this an oligarchy where only a few people rule and they rule in their own interests? And so after watching this video, look at the world around you. Think about in the United States or whatever country you are watching from, what elements of a participatory democracy do you see? What elements of a pluralist democracy? And what elements of an elite democracy do you see? And as we'll see in other videos, these dimensions of democracy were vigorously debated by the founding fathers when they thought about whether to ratify the Constitution. We'll see this debate when we look at the anti-federalist papers, especially we'll look closely at Brutus number one. We'll see this debate when we look at the Federalist papers, especially Federalist number 10 written by James Madison. And I'll let you decide when we look at that who was right and what flavors of democracy are most dominant in the United States at different levels."
16af0eb7-190a-46ce-8809-5aceeaad7d3d,"As we talked about in other videos, shortly after the Declaration of Independence in July of 1776, the representatives from what were colonies but now self-declared states had to think about how to organize themselves. And so they start drafting the Articles of Confederation which go into effect in 1781. Now as we'll see, these Articles of Confederation do not provide for any type of real central government. It really was a mutual defense union with a little bit of free trade, as we'll see in the text here. This is some of the beginning passages of the Articles of Confederation. And I encourage you to read the whole thing. It's actually quite interesting. But you immediately see that it has a very different tone than the one that we see in the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution starts with we the people while the Articles of Confederation starts with to all to whom these presents shall come. So it's almost kind of an awkward business letter. We the undersigned delegates of the states affixed to our names send greeting. Articles of Confederation and perpetual union between the states of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. The style of this confederacy shall be the United States of America. Each, this part is interesting, each state retains its sovereignty. So it rules over itself. It's not giving up its sovereignty to some type of a union. So it retains its sovereignty, its freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled. So they're really viewing themselves as independent countries that are next to each other that for the sake of fighting the Revolutionary War agreed to things like mutual defense and free trade, but they are really separate countries. The said states hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other for their common defense, so this is that mutual defense idea, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other against all force offered to or attacks made upon them or any of them on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretense whatever. And then it says the better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different states in this union, the free inhabitants of each of these states shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several states, and the people of each state shall free ingress and regress to and from any other state, and shall enjoy therein all the privileges of trade and commerce. So people can travel back and forth between these states, there would be free trade, but these would be viewed as different countries. One interesting thing that you don't hear people talk a lot about, there's even a little passage here that allows Canada to join this confederation. Canada, acceding to this confederation and adjoining in the measures of the United States shall be admitted into and entitled to all the advantages of this union, but no other colony shall be admitted into the same unless such admission be agreed to by nine states. So they're saying, hey, if Canada agrees, they are pre-agreeing to allow Canada to join this union, which Canada obviously does not join. But it's interesting to think that they thought about this. Now what are the weaknesses here? Well, the most obvious one, I don't have the entire Articles of Confederation here, but how does this United States of America wield its power? Where does its money come from? It turns out that if it needs to generate revenue in order to take some action, it can't tax the citizens of the states. The states can only do that themselves. Instead, it has to apply to the states in order to contribute to the United States of America. If you wanted to take some type of unified action, well, you would have to have delegates from the various states and meet together and decide what to do. You wouldn't have any strong leader being able to take decisive action. And so there really wasn't a notion of a central government here. There wasn't even a notion of one country, one nation. It really was about different sovereign states. And all of this, as we'll see, will come to a head in the mid-1780s. The United States has a significant amount of debt exiting the American Revolutionary War, debt to countries like France. You also have debt on an individual level. Merchants owe money to European merchants and traders and lenders. And these lenders weren't interested in paper currency from these newly created states. They wanted hard currency. They wanted gold and they want silver. And so many of the merchants in the United States in turn put pressure on the people they lent money to, especially poor farmers, many of whom had been veterans in the Revolutionary War, to pay their debts in hard currency. And so you can imagine these poor farmers who were kind of the bottom of this food chain were in a pretty tough mind. They had fought in the Revolutionary War. They had risked their lives. Many of them had been injured, but they actually did not get paid for their service to a large degree. And then now they were not able to even survive as farmers because not only were they not able to borrow new funds, but some of their existing funds they had to pay back in hard currency which wasn't available in the United States. And so all of this tension eventually comes to a head in Western Massachusetts. This right here is a picture of Daniel Shays who was one of these poor farmers in Western Massachusetts who was also a veteran of the American Revolutionary War who was not paid for his service. And so he eventually becomes one of the leaders of these rebellious former veterans, poor farmers, and they start taking the courthouses of Western Massachusetts, making them inoperable. These are the courthouses where people had to report to in order to talk about how they would repay their debt. Well, you can imagine this worried many of the merchants who these people owed their debt to. It also worried many of the founding fathers because it took some time for the government of Massachusetts to be able to react to this. And while that was happening through mid-1786 and into the beginning of 1787, this rebellion got stronger and stronger and stronger. Eventually, on January 25th, 1787, we see things coming to a head where Daniel Shays is leading his rebels to take the armory in Springfield, Massachusetts, which is in Western Massachusetts, but it's stopped by a militia. This is a militia that's paid for by merchants in the area who probably want their debts paid or just wanted functioning courthouses or did not want all of these rioting farmers and former veterans. And so this rebellion is put down, but it shows the weakness inherent in the Articles of Confederation. This rebellion starts having the potential to spread well beyond Massachusetts, but there was not a coordinated action. In fact, it took many months to even be able to field a militia against the rebellion. It also highlighted the weakness of not having one central government that can take decisive action, also one central government that could generate its own revenue through taxing the citizens of all of the states and using that for things like a military or being able to negotiate debts with foreign countries. And so Shays' Rebellion is cited by many historians as one of the main catalysts after it was put down for having the Constitutional Convention in mid-1787 to rethink the Articles of Confederation. Now, as we talked about in other videos, many people went to this convention thinking, we're not just gonna edit the Articles of Confederation. We need to create a stronger central government. We need a federalist system where, yes, the states can have rights, but we also need a central government. We need a strong leader at the head of that central government. And so they do draft what is now the Constitution at this convention. Then after the convention, they sell this new Constitution, because remember, it has to be ratified by the states through the Federalist Papers, which we also talk about in other videos. Hamilton organized it, but James Madison and John Jay, also significant contributors. And eventually, the Articles of Confederation does get replaced. The Constitution is ratified, and it becomes effective on March 4th, 1789."
92afce45-fd45-4d10-b330-6cba00ae4968,"An idea that will keep coming up as you study economics is the idea of the four factors of production, which are usually listed as land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. And the idea here is if you want to produce anything, so let's just say this circle is the production process, and this arrow is the output, you need inputs. Now, you might have many, many, many inputs. You might need supplies, you might need a factory, you might need people to work in the factory. You need all of these different things, but the idea of the four factors of production is that these things can all be classified in one of these four groups, as either land, labor, capital, or entrepreneurship. Now, these words have meaning in everyday language, and so some of it might jump out at you. Of course, if you need to build a factory or if you need a farm, you need land to do so. And you can see that in this example here where we see a farm. Clearly, they need a lot of land in order to have the farm. Even in a garment factory, this is a picture of a garment factory from maybe 100 years ago. Even there, they needed land on which to build the factory, so this floor is sitting on land. And land doesn't just have to strictly mean land in an economics context. It can mean natural resources in general. This could be things like water or air or energy. So in some context, instead of land, some people might say natural resources for this first factor of production. Now, another important factor of production, and arguably they are all important, is the idea of labor. To produce many or most things, someone has to work on it. So someone had to plant these seeds and they will have to harvest these crops. The labor is very clear here. You see people putting in work in order to produce the product right over there. Now, capital is an interesting one. It means one thing in everyday language, and it means something slightly more specific when we talk about it in an economics context. In an economic context, capital is something produced to produce other things. So examples of capital would be tools that you use to produce other things. It could be a building that you need in order to produce other things. It could be the machinery in a factory. So in these two pictures, there's many examples of capital. You could view this table and the tools that these folks are using. That is capital. You could view the whole building itself and all of the light fixtures and all of that as capital. So all of this stuff is capital. The hangers that they're putting the coats on after they produce it, that is capital. In this farm example, the capital would be the buildings. These were constructed so that they could produce the food from the farm. This little, it looks like some type of machinery there, that is capital for the farm. It's being used to produce the output of the farm. Now, the place that that's different than everyday language, in everyday language when people talk about capital, they'll often include financial capital, financial assets that could be used to get benefit in the future, things like money. But in an economic context, we are not considering financial assets. We're only thinking about things that were produced in order to produce other things. The fourth factor of production is entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship in our everyday language means putting things together so you're trying to create other things. When someone's an entrepreneur, you might imagine someone who's trying to start a business. In an economic context, it has a related idea. Entrepreneurship is putting together all of the other factors of production so that you can actually produce things. You can't just randomly build buildings and randomly plant seeds. Someone has to think about how do you put these things together so that you can produce things in a reasonable way. And obviously, you wanna produce as much as possible given the other factors that you are putting into the production. A related idea, and it sometimes is used interchangeably in an economics course, is technology. So sometimes you'll see the four factors of production is land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship, and sometimes you'll see it listed as land, labor, capital, and technology. But when you see this, when you see technology as a factor of production, don't think about it as technology in everyday language where you think of computer chips or software. When people are talking about technology as a factor of production, they are really talking about entrepreneurship. They're talking about the know-how of putting together the other factors of production in order to produce that output. Finally, I wanna leave on one idea, the idea of the two types of things that could be produced from all of these factors of production. Broadly speaking, we could produce something that could be used to produce more things, and we already talked about it. We could be, in that situation, be producing capital goods. So that could be that we are constructing a factory that itself maybe produces tools for other people to use in some other production process. The other option we have is to produce what are known as consumption goods. Consumption goods. Consumption goods are goods that are just used. It might make people happy. They might find pleasure in it, but it's not being used to produce other things. And because our production resources are scarce, there's a trade-off when a society or a factory or whoever decides how much capital to produce versus how much consumption goods. You need some consumption goods. Otherwise, frankly, we wouldn't have clothing on. We wouldn't be eating nice meals. We wouldn't be able to enjoy our lives. But at the same time, you also need capital. If we did only consumption goods, at some point, we wouldn't have all the things we need to produce the consumption goods. So it's a very interesting trade-off that we'll explore more in future videos."
2c4e049a-2bc0-47e8-b65a-6605a5b738b4,"Hello readers, today I want to talk about themes. A theme is an important idea that is woven throughout a story. It's not the plot or the summary, but something a little deeper. A theme links a big idea about our world with the action of a text. Sometimes a theme answers a question the story is trying to explore, like what does it mean to be a family? Or what are we afraid of? Themes will be statements that answer these questions, like you don't have to be related to someone for them to be your family, or we are afraid of losing our individuality. Now, theme is different from the main idea of a story or its summary. The main idea is what the story is all about, and the summary is the events of the story. It's the plot, it's what happened. But the theme is a lesson or a message that you can take out of the story and apply to your own life. Themes are universal, that is to say anyone can relate to them. So if I tell you a story about how I got food poisoning the one time I ate a sketchy roadside hot dog instead of packing my own lunch, the theme isn't avoid Sticky Pete's hot dogs on Route 91, the theme is it pays to be prepared, because not everyone has a Sticky Pete's, but everyone can be prepared. Ugh, why did I eat it? Why is it green? A theme is similar to a moral, but a moral is more about a specific lesson it's trying to teach you. A theme could be a lesson, but it doesn't have to be. Sometimes you can discover the theme by asking yourself some big questions. What did the characters learn? How did they grow and change? Why did characters act the way they acted? What's different at the end of the story? And what stays with you after the story is over? Let's go through a folktale and see if answering these questions helps us to uncover the theme. This is a story about Anansi the spider. A heroic trickster from West Africa. Anansi was clever, but he wished to be wise. Wiser than everyone, in fact. He decided that he'd take all the wisdom he could find, all the wisdom in the whole world, and gather it all inside a little clay pot. But he didn't like having it in the house, this pot of knowledge. What if our kid knocks it over? He asked his wife, Aso. What if someone comes over in the night and steals it? Who's coming to steal your pot, Anansi? She asked. Nobody even knows you have it. It's not safe, Anansi cried, and he decided to hide it. I'm going out, he said. Don't follow me. Whatever, said Aso, who went back to doing something that was actually useful. Anansi wandered through the forest, lugging this enormous clay pot of wisdom, never aware that his little son, Ntikuma, was following close behind. Not tall enough, said Anansi, looking at a cliff. Not deep enough, he said, frowning at a canyon. Aha, said Anansi, when he came to the prickly thorn tree at the edge of the forest, near a little stream. Now this will do just fine. Anansi had many legs, and he was very strong, but even he could not climb the tree and carry the pot of knowledge at the same time. He scrabbled up the tree, then slid back down again. He wiggled up the tree, then slid back down again. He clambered up the tree. Hey, dad, Anansi's son called out. What, what? I said nobody follow me. What are you doing here, Anansi cried. You should tie the pot to your back, dad. Then you can use all your legs to climb the tree. He was right, but it didn't matter to Anansi. I'll teach you to give me advice, you little miscreant, Anansi yelled, shaking his fist. The same fist that held the handle to the pot full of wisdom. It went sailing into the air as time seemed to slow down. Oh no, said Anansi. Oh no, said Anansi's little son. And the pot smashed open right there in the stream, carrying all of Anansi's carefully gathered up knowledge into the ocean, sending it out to the whole world once again. You are in so much trouble, Ntikuma, Anansi said, clambering back down the tree. And then he said, ow, ow, ow, because in his haste, he had poked himself on the thorns of the tree. His son took off running for home and Anansi raced after him. And as they ran, it began to rain. And as the rain came down, Anansi stopped running and began to walk and think. Ntikuma's plan would have worked after all. When he at last caught up with Ntikuma, he apologized for losing his temper. What was the use of all that wisdom if I can still be outsmarted by my little son, he said. The two of them embraced. And because of Ntikuma's timely interruption, a little bit of Anansi's knowledge lives in us all today. So our questions checklist, what did the characters learn? Well, Anansi learned that even if he had all the wisdom in the world, a child could still have a better idea than him. How did the characters grow and change? Anansi apologized for losing his temper and realized that he wasn't the only person with good ideas. Why did characters act the way they acted? I think Anansi was greedy. Why else would he wanna have all the wisdom in the world and not share it with anybody else? And what's different at the end of the story? At the end of the story, everybody gets a little bit from the pot of wisdom. It flows out into the ocean and gets sent to everybody. And Anansi realized that keeping all the wisdom to himself still didn't make him the wisest all the time. Finally, what stays with you after the story is over? The fact that all of us, you, me, your Aunt Matilda, all of us have a little bit of Anansi's wisdom inside of us. So a theme of this story could be anyone can have a good idea or wisdom is inside all of us. What theme would you give this story? Discuss it with your friends, your classmates, your family, and let us know. The theme of all of my videos is and shall forever be that you can learn anything. David out."
14be9cc4-c4f9-4ab5-ae95-f22ebca8abc4,"Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy, and today I'm learning more about Article 7 of the U.S. Constitution, which is the provision that specified the conditions for the Constitution to become law. It reads, the ratification of the conventions of nine states shall be sufficient for the establishment of this Constitution between the states so ratifying the same. Although this sounds simple, it reminds us that when the framers finished drafting the Constitution in Philadelphia in 1787, it was by no means a done deal. At least nine states had to ratify the Constitution in order to replace the existing government under the Articles of Confederation. To learn more about the ratification process, I sought out the help of two experts. Mark Graber is the Jacob A. France Professor of Constitutionalism at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law. Michael Rapoport is the Darling Foundation Professor at the University of San Diego School of Law. Professor Graber, can you tell us a little bit about the political context of ratification? What was going on at this time as the framers tried to put a new Constitution into the fabric of the United States? Well, one central problem of the Articles of Confederation was the Articles required that all 13 states consent for any amendment. And it turned out at this time, Rhode Island was a great outlier, so Rhode Island wasn't gonna consent to much of anything. And in fact, Rhode Island did not even send delegates to the convention that drafted the Constitution. So the framers knew that if you had the unanimous rule for ratification, it would not work. So instead they chose nine, it's about 2 3rds, 3 4ths, in part to make sure Rhode Island and one outlier could not prevent adoption. So let's remember there's two stages here in how the Constitution gets written and ratified. So first it's written in what's called the Drafting Convention or the Philadelphia Convention, which was held during the summer of 1787. And in that convention, there was pretty much an agreement that the federal government needed to be made stronger. But that was just a proposal. In order for the Constitution to be ratified, it needed nine of the 13 states. And so it went to the second stage. And there things were in some ways gonna be more difficult because there was a variety of viewpoints in the different states. And the main question that came up in state after state after state was, was the federal government being given too much additional power? Under the previous regime of the Articles of Confederation, the federal government had very limited powers. And the Constitution was gonna give the federal government more power. They wanted a strategy that once the ball started rolling, states that were slower were gonna be faced with a choice. You could get in on the inside and maybe affect some changes early. But if you were left out, whatever happened would happen without you. And a lot of states at the end were fearful of being left out. This strategy worked. And as they went through in tough states, as time went on, so New Hampshire, Virginia, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, in order to get ratification, each time they promised we'll have a Bill of Rights. And those states added a list of amendments that they wanted added to the Constitution. So was it controversial that the framers decided that only nine states would be necessary to ratify the Constitution? Very controversial. One of the central points of anti-federalists was that this was illegal, that the existing Constitution said all states, and therefore only all states could change the Constitution. So in that respect, it was somewhat controversial. Another way in which it departed from the Articles, so the Articles said you needed the state legislatures to approve the amendments. And the U.S. Constitution said no, we want state conventions, special bodies elected by the people to approve these things. Why did they say that? Because they feared that the state legislatures who would be losing a lot of power under the Constitution would vote against it. So they wanted sort of to go directly to the people in these conventions and bypass the state legislatures. So we know that there were some opponents of this new Constitution. How close did they actually come to preventing its ratification? Well, it was a very close fight. We look back on it and eventually all 13 states are gonna ratify and it just looks like, oh, well, that wasn't too much of a trouble. But it was very close and things could have easily gone in the opposite direction. One of the ways in which it was close was that there were just very close votes. Massachusetts was 187 to 168. New Hampshire was 57-47. New York was 30-27. So very close votes in Malta. You know, a couple of people changing their mind and that would have meant various states didn't ratify. In addition to that, some of the states actually did not ratify. So the first thing that happened was Rhode Island, early on in the process, says, we don't like your horrible Constitution. They all expected that. We're not gonna hold even a convention. You want us to hold a convention? We're not gonna hold a convention. We're just gonna have a vote in the state. And that vote in the state, 90% of the people voted against the Constitution. So in a way, Rhode Island actually voted against ratification, although they didn't use the proper method. North Carolina also, they held a convention and they were very upset about there not being a Bill of Rights in the Constitution. And they just didn't approve it. They didn't disapprove it. They just did nothing. And they waited. So in a way, two of the states voted against ratification. North Carolina had not yet ratified when George Washington took office. So in fact, when George Washington took office, there were only 11 states in the union. At the end of the day, crucial people, I think, decided it was better to sign the Constitution and be in on the ground floor than stay out and see what happened. Interesting. So who are some of the major players involved here and what were they arguing about? There were the Federalists who were arguing in favor of ratifying the Constitution and the Anti-Federalists who were arguing against ratifying the Constitution. So the Federalists, two of the very famous ones, are familiar names, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison. Those two people, though, were also particularly important because they decided, Hamilton said, we're gonna have a tough time getting ratification in New York. We need to write some essays defending the Constitution. And so Hamilton and Madison cooperated together and wrote what we now call the Federalist Papers, which were simply essays written in the newspapers trying to urge the New York Convention to ratify the Constitution. Eventually, those essays were sent to other states and became known, and now we come to revere those essays as the Federalist Papers. But they were originally just kind of advocacy pieces for ratifying the Convention. Now, there were also Anti-Federalists. The Anti-Federalists, in part, were simply people who opposed the Constitution. And just as it's the case that, say, people opposed Obamacare from both the left and the right, people who opposed the Constitution opposed it for many different reasons, and one of their problems was they were not a united bunch. But in general, these were people fearful of a very strong national government. They believed states were sovereign, they wanted to keep power local, and they were very fearful of what they perceived to be an elite who would run the Constitution after ratification. The names that people may know who were Anti-Federalists were people like Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams. So what were some of the major arguments made in favor of adopting this new Constitution? There were, I think, two types of arguments. People felt that the Articles were not working properly. They had all kinds of problems. And one of the strongest arguments that the Federalist Papers made was that if we don't fix this and make for a stronger union together, what'll happen is we'll break apart. Look at what happens when you have a bunch of states all next to one another in a land area. We know what that looks like. It's called Europe. And what happens in Europe? They fight wars with one another all the time. And those wars are very problematic. You have to have big armies, standing armies. Now, there were also the particular arguments about what powers were missing that the federal government had. The main arguments were made was the federal government did not have enough power. So they didn't have, for example, the taxing power, and they didn't have a way of enforcing treaties against the states very well. And some of the states were putting tariffs up, so interfering with trade within the country. So states would set tariffs on out-of-state goods. States wouldn't contribute to the national government. Second, we needed to present a united front to foreign governments. So we were very worried. What would happen if South Carolina formed an alliance with England and North Carolina formed an alliance with France? That would be good. The country needed to speak with one voice. So those are some of the arguments made for adopting the Constitution. What were some of the arguments against adopting this new Constitution? Well, first argument was, even though most anti-federalists admitted the Articles needed some repair, they said it's not really urgent. It's not like the House is gonna fall down tomorrow. It's just, you know, the wind is coming through and we can figure it out. We really want a better Constitution. The other arguments were the Constitution put too much power in the national government. It put too much power in elites. The fear was if you had national elections, only elites would win. If you had local elections, people, the people actually knew would win. So they thought a big national government would be too far away from the people to know what they really needed, as opposed to state governments, which they perceived as being sort of more personal, closer to the needs of individuals. So compare two kinds of elections. First, how many people really know anyone who runs for senator, who runs for president, that you're on a first-name basis with? Now compare you're in a school club. Chances are, when someone runs for an officer of the school club, you know who they are. Another type of argument was, if you give the federal government this power, and even if, and the Federalists always argue that the power was limited, that they were being given to the federal government, and the Anti-Federalists came back and said, well, you say it's limited, but what we know from historical experience is that once a government's in power, it tends to seize more power. There's a lot of vague phrases in the Constitution, and the federal government will use those vague phrases to assert greater and greater power. What were some of the strategies that the Framers used to entice some of the opponents of a strong central government to ratify the Constitution? So the first thing that they did was to try to build up momentum. So they knew there were certain states which were strongly in favor of ratification. Small states sometimes wanted ratification. So the first state that comes in is Delaware, and they vote 30 to zero for the Constitution. And a bunch of early states, so let's say the first five states all vote for ratification by pretty lopsided margins. So that builds up a kind of momentum. All right, we have five states. We only need four more. Of course, the next ones that were gonna come were gonna be much more difficult, and they then needed to change their strategy at that point. You know, they argued like crazy. The Federalist Papers are a very famous example. They indicated they'd be open to amendment once the Constitution was ratified. Then again in Pennsylvania, when anti-Federalists boycotted the convention, and the result is the convention didn't have a quorum, they ordered the Sergeant-at-Arms to a tavern. The Sergeant-at-Arms found some boycotting anti-Federalists and physically put them in the building so they could count for a quorum. That's terrific. That one doesn't get told in a whole lot of history books. Wow. The framers could play rough and tumble politics with the best of them. A lot of the things that pop up at the time of the framing, I think we look back on today and imagine how would this work in today's era with 330 million Americans? Do you think the system under the Articles of Confederation with a smaller, more local government could possibly work today? Well, among other things, the Articles had no great means of collecting taxes or gaining revenue. Given that modern government needs trillions of dollars, the Articles, if you got $1,000, it was a miracle. So the Articles clearly don't work. But the Articles were inadequate for 18th century government. They were clearly inadequate or would be clearly inadequate for 21st century government. Now, the Constitution appears to have been adequate for 18th century government. Whether it is adequate for 21st century government is a fair question. One of the interesting questions about the Constitution is how democratic is the Constitution? This debate about how democratic the Constitution is actually enters into the question about ratification. On one level, the Constitution was democratic because each state in these ratification conventions voted on whether to ratify by majority vote. On the other hand, at the federal level, the ratification requirement required nine out of 13. And the idea there would be we needed more buy-in. We needed a limitation on simple majority rule in order to make the system function well, in order to produce a Constitution that would have support from the whole country. The interesting thing about that supermajority rule and something that people don't often make the connection with is we probably owe our Bill of Rights to that supermajority rule. Because if only seven of the 13 states, the mere majority, had been needed to ratify the Constitution, then it's quite possible that the federalists wouldn't have had to promise to put a Bill of Rights into the Constitution because they wouldn't have needed to. And they were initially quite opposed to putting a Bill of Rights in the Constitution. It was only the fact that they needed nine out of the 13 states that really forced their hand and forced them to promise that they would put the Bill of Rights in there. So we see in terms of the ratification that there's both sort of democratic elements but also Republican or supermajority elements. So we've learned that it wasn't easy to ratify the Constitution. The framers bypassed state legislatures and went directly to the people in state conventions, hoping that momentum and arguments for a stronger federal government would entice the opponents of the Constitution to ratify it. It took until 1789 for nine out of 13 states to ratify the Constitution and finally make it law.

0be52a33-70a8-435b-8ffc-092eb5bb6dc9,"Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy, and today I'm learning more about Article Six of the U.S. Constitution. Article Six is, as we'll soon see, kind of a constitutional grab bag. It covers debts, religious tests for office, and it establishes the Constitution as the supreme law of the land. To learn more about what binds these diverse ideas together, I sought out the help of two experts. Kermit Roosevelt is a professor of law specializing in constitutional law and conflict of laws at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. And Michael Ramsey is professor of law and director of international and comparative law programs at the University of San Diego School of Law. So let's start out talking about the debts portion of Article Six. Professor Roosevelt, why were the framers so interested in debt? What was the historical context that led them to explicitly address debt in Article Six? Well, debt is important generally because nations often need to borrow money. And specifically with the Constitution and the Articles of Confederation, the U.S. government had been borrowing money to pay for the Revolutionary War. So there was a question, we're moving from a sort of loose confederation, almost like a treaty between nations, under the Articles of Confederation, to a single unitary country with a stronger national government under the Constitution. And there's a question, is it still the same country? Will the new United States pay the debts of the old United States? Now, there's a general principle of international law that a successor government undertakes the obligations of the predecessor. So you wouldn't necessarily think this would be a problem, but I think they were particularly concerned because the idea of a republic was a somewhat new one, at least in the 18th century, somewhat unusual one. And the change of a Republican government might cause some worries in Europe where this money was owed. So I think they just wanted to reassure all of the creditors that even if they were changing their method of government, that that wasn't going to affect any of the debts. What might have happened had they decided not to pay those debts? If they decided not to pay the debts, then other countries would probably have been much less willing to lend money to the new United States because they might've thought, well, you know, another change in government could occur. There was substantial question throughout the world whether the United States would be able to survive in the face of all the challenges that they had after gaining their independence. So in order to make it seem that the United States was a country that could be trusted, a country that could be expected to stick around and not collapse into chaos or revert to colonial status, one of the most important things for them was to show that the debts would be honored because a failure to honor debts would suggest that the country did not in fact have true sovereignty and was not prepared to be a actor on the international stage that could be trusted. Another interesting thing to contrast this to is the treatment of debts after the Civil War, where of course the United States, the federal government, paid its own debts, but there's a provision in the 14th Amendment explicitly repudiating the Confederate debt. So if you loaned money to the Confederate States of America, you're never getting that back because we didn't treat that as a valid government that would be continued going forward. Another thing that it illustrates is that the Constitution in some respects was a visionary document that was concerned with the long-term future of the United States, but in other respects, it responded to very immediate practical problems that the framers faced in their day. They were thinking about not just the future of the country for the ages, and they were thinking about that, but they weren't thinking just about that. They were also thinking about reassuring France with respect to the debts that existed right at that moment. So there's a lot going on in Article VI, and specifically, it talks about the Constitution as the supreme law of the land. So what's important about that statement? What's important about that is that it means the Constitution is our highest law. It prevails over any other kind of law in a conflict. So one thing that that means is the Constitution is supreme over state law, and then the Constitution actually goes on to talk about that a little bit more. But it also means the Constitution is supreme over federal law. So everyone is bound by the Constitution. The states can't go against it. Congress can't go past it. The president can't violate constitutional restrictions. The Constitution is really the last word. It's the pinnacle or the keystone of the arch of American democracy. And that's why we can say that things are unconstitutional, that laws are unconstitutional, and therefore, invalid. And most importantly, it's why the Supreme Court can say that laws are unconstitutional and invalid. It creates a superior law that limits the laws that can be passed by the other parts of the government. It creates a hierarchy of laws, and in doing so, it assures that we have a single set of rules that applies to all the states and to the federal government, and it can't be changed except by an amendment, which is relatively difficult to do. There's a procedure in the Constitution for how you can amend the Constitution, but until amended, the Constitution, as written, is our superior law. And that was different from the way that the framers, the rules the framers were used to under the English system, where they didn't have a written Constitution. They had an unwritten Constitution, but that Constitution was subject to change by Parliament. So has the supremacy of the Constitution been tested over time? There haven't been a lot of claims that the Constitution is not supreme. So generally speaking, everyone gives at least lip service to this idea. What's been tested is more the question of who gets to decide what the Constitution means and when something conflicts with it. So if you want the Constitution and federal law to be supreme, probably you would wanna have someone in the federal government deciding when there's a conflict, say, with state law. And the forms that resistance has taken over the years are more states saying, not we can go against the Constitution, we're above the Constitution, but states saying, we don't think what we're doing violates the Constitution, right? And you, the Supreme Court, you think it does, but you're wrong. In the 19th century, just before the Civil War, the Supreme Court decided in the Dred Scott case that African-Americans could not be citizens of the United States, even if they were freed slaves. And President Lincoln believed that that was wrong. He said that there was nothing in the Constitution that denied the ability of them to be citizens. And he said that the Supreme Court had misinterpreted the Constitution, and he would not accept the Supreme Court's ruling in that regard. Later, in the 20th century, the Supreme Court held that the Constitution barred segregation, particularly in schools, in the Brown versus Board of Education case. But many Southern governors and other institutions throughout the South thought that the Supreme Court had gotten that one wrong, and they refused to abide by what the Supreme Court had said the Constitution means. What they said was not the Constitution doesn't bind us, but we know what the Constitution means better than you, Supreme Court. You're wrong, you're making this up. It's political, let's not judge it. Another thing that Article VI talks about is religious tests. Why were the framers so interested in preventing religious tests in government? What sort of historical evils were they trying to prevent? So this is connected to the basic idea of the separation of church and state. And you separate church and state, really, to protect both of those things. So you want to protect religion from being corrupted by political considerations, but you also want to protect your political system from being a battleground between rival religions. So where this comes from is that in England, they had had a series of what they called test acts. And what the test acts did was it required for people to be eligible for government offices, that people had to be members of the Church of England, and that other religious groups, they were barred by the test acts from holding government office. So actually, many of those minority religions, many adherents of those, ended up coming to the American colonies to gain some measure of religious freedom. The Pilgrims were an example of that. There was a Catholic colony in Maryland. And just generally speaking, many of the people, many of the colonists who came over were people who were not part of the main established church in England. And so you can see why they would not want to have something like the test acts. And they wanted to make clear that in the new national government, that any religion or no religion would be allowed for government office holders. Do you think it's true that we don't have religious tests or oaths in the United States? How about the practice of swearing on a Bible during the presidential inauguration? Well, the practice of swearing on a Bible is very interesting, as is the fact that when the president recites the oath of office, every president, going back to George Washington, has added on to the end of it, so help me God. There's actually an oath in the constitution the president has to swear to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution. But the constitution doesn't say, so help me God. The presidents just add that on on their own. And actually that sort of illustrates the way in which the constitution treats religion, which is it can't be part of government in an official sense. But we know that members of government are also people and they have religious beliefs that are important to them. And we don't demand that they exclude religion from their lives, we just demand that it be separated from government authority. So you can swear on a Bible if you want to. You don't have to. You can swear on some other religious book. We had a member of Congress take an oath of office on a Koran. So individual government officials are allowed to include religion insofar as it's about them personally. You know, what you think is appropriate to mark this occasion? What solemnifies this oath for you? You can do that. But we can't require it and they can't make the exercise of their power religious in nature. So you can't, you know, as a government official, exercise your power on religious grounds. Something that strikes me about Article VI is that it addresses so many different things. Do you have a sense of why debts and constitutional supremacy and religious tests are all in one article? Article VI, as you said, is a little bit of a grab bag. It's not entirely clear how these different pieces of Article VI relate to each other. And I think they were just things that the framers wanted in the Constitution and didn't know for sure where else to put them. I'm not exactly sure why the debts are there. If I had to say something about Article VI, it's sort of the glue that holds the constitutional architecture together. So maybe the debts are in there to explain the continuity between the US government under the Articles of Confederation and the US government under the Constitution. Then the Supremacy Clause explains how all of the different parts of the federal system are supposed to fit together. And what the Supremacy Clause is saying is the Constitution is above all of them. The Constitution connects them all. Everyone has to abide by the Constitution. And it tells you the Constitution is the highest law, then you've got federal law, and then below that is state law. So that if there's a conflict between federal law and state law, the federal law is gonna win. And then the last part of Article VI is sort of doing the same thing. Because what holds a country together? What binds people into a single people? In a lot of countries at the time of the founding, it was religion. Religion was the glue that held the society together. And if you weren't a member of that religion, you were an outsider, you were a second-class citizen, you would be shunned and not given equal rights in some ways. The last clause of Article VI says something sort of similar about America, except it explicitly says it's not religion that binds us together. No religious test can be required. But you do have to take an oath. What do you have to pledge to support? You have to pledge to support the Constitution. So there again, it's telling you the Constitution is what we all have in common. That's what makes us Americans. That really is the glue that binds our society together. So we've learned that Article VI is, as Professor Roosevelt put it, the glue that binds the country together. In assuming the debts from the era of the Articles of Confederation, Article VI established the continuity of U.S. government. It also placed the Constitution, not religion, as the supreme law of the United States.

So we're gonna think about under what scenarios a firm would make an economic profit or an economic loss in them. Now as a reminder, these perfectly competitive markets are something of a theoretical ideal. There's few markets in the real world that are truly perfectly competitive. Some might get close, but most markets are someplace in a spectrum between perfectly competitive and at the other extreme, say something like a monopoly. But here we're talking about perfect competition. And in perfect competition, the firm's products aren't differentiated. There's no barriers to entry or exit. And so in that situation, the market supply and demand curves are going to define the price in the market, which are also going to define the marginal revenue for these firms. They're all going to be price takers. They're gonna be passive in terms of price. Whatever the market price is, that's the price that they are going to sell their products for. And their decision is really what quantity to produce and sell, and whether to enter or exit the market. So let's look at that a little bit. So these are just your classic and supply and demand curves you might see for a market. The first few units in the market, there's a huge marginal benefit, so people are willing to pay a lot. But then each incremental unit, the marginal benefit's a little bit lower and lower and lower and lower, and that's why we have that downward sloping demand curve. And then on the supply curve, the first unit in the market might be fairly inexpensive to produce, but then the marginal cost gets higher and higher and higher. And where they meet, where the supply and demand meet, that tells us the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity in the market. And we can show that with that line, and let's just say that equilibrium price is $10. And as I just mentioned, that's going to have to be the price that all of the firms, and these might not be all of the firms in the market, but all of the firms in the market, if we're talking about a perfectly competitive market, would just have to take that price. So given that, what quantity would firms A, B, and C produce, and which of these firms would be profitable or not? I encourage you to pause the video and think about those two questions. If you could just answer which of these firms would be profitable or not, and we're talking about economic profit in this context. All right, well let's look at firm A first. Well, firm A, for any of them, it is not rational to produce a quantity where the marginal cost is higher than the marginal revenue that the firm's getting. And remember, this line right over here, this line right here, which is the price line, that's also, that is price, which is equal to marginal revenue. And so for that extra unit, if you can't sell it for more than you're producing, you wouldn't produce that extra unit. So it's rational for them to produce more and more and more. The marginal cost goes higher and higher until right at the point that marginal cost is equal to marginal revenue, which is equal to price, the market price, which they're just going to take. So it's rational for this firm to produce this quantity right over here. So I'll just go quantity, I'll say quantity for that firm. Now is this firm going to be profitable or not? Well, this quantity, what's its average total cost? Well, its average total cost is right over there. And so for every unit, it's going to make this difference between the price or the marginal revenue it's getting and its average total cost. And so one way to think about the profit of this firm is, and we're talking about economic profit, it's going to be the area of this rectangle right over here. So let's say if the average total cost at that quantity is, let's say that this is $8, then this height of the rectangle is 10 minus eight, the height right over here, let me do this in a different color, this height right over here is $2, and then the width is going to be the quantity of that firm. And so let's say the quantity of that firm, let's say it's 10,000 units a year, 10,000, 10,000 units per year. And so the area right over here would be $2 times 10,000. It would be $20,000, $20,000 per time unit, if we're talking all of this is, say, per year. Now let's go to firm B. Using that same analysis, is firm B making an economic profit or is it not making an economic profit? Well, firm B is once again going to be a price taker. And so the price right over here, the equilibrium price of the market, is going to be equal to the price that that firm has to take, which is going to be its marginal revenue curve. And that's why it's a flat marginal revenue curve, because no matter what quantity they produce, they're gonna get that same price. And it wouldn't be rational for them to produce a quantity where marginal cost is higher than marginal revenue. And so they would produce right over there. Now what is their economic profit at this quantity? So this is quantity of the second firm, firm B. I'll write it like that. Maybe that is firm A. And maybe this is also, it looks about the same. I'll make them a little bit different. Let's say that's 9,500 units per time period. Well, here the average total cost at that quantity is equal to the marginal cost, so which is equal to the marginal revenue. So at that quantity, whatever that $10 they're getting per unit, they're also spending on average $10 per unit. Another way to think about it, the area of that rectangle is going to be zero because it has no height. So this situation right over here, the firm has zero economic, I'll write zero dollars of economic profit. And then last but not least, let's think about firm C. Pause this video and think about what its economic profit would be. Well, like we've seen, it would be rational for it to produce the quantity where marginal cost is equal to marginal revenue, which is equal to the market price. So it would produce this quantity right over here. And let's say that that quantity is 9,000 units. And what's its average total cost then? So at 9,000 units, its average total cost, let's say that that is $12 right over there. So what's its economic profit? So for every unit it's selling, it's getting $10 and it's costing $12 on average to produce it. So it's taking an economic loss of $2 per unit. So $2 per unit, so this height right over here is $2, times the units times 9,000, you're going to have two times 9,000, you're going to have an $18,000 not economic profit, but economic, economic loss. Now, one thing to think about is why would any firm be in this situation? Well, it's important to think about things in the short run versus the long run. In the short run, we've talked about this analysis right over here, where a firm can decide what quantity it would produce that is rational. Its fixed costs are fixed in the short run. We've studied that in multiple videos. But in the long run, its fixed costs aren't fixed, and so the firm could decide to enter or exit the market. And so for firm C, while they've already put in those fixed costs, it is actually rational for them to do it because they're actually able to make the marginal revenue they get up to that quantity, it's at least they're able to more than cover their marginal costs, and then they're able to eat up, or I guess you could say take care of some of their fixed costs, but they're still not able to run an economic profit. So in the long run, it wouldn't be rational for this firm to stay in the market. They would likely exit the market."
bc04bc47-c674-49f8-a5bb-ee9079f1c942,"What we're going to do in this video is talk about two related ideas that are really the foundations of economics. The idea of scarcity and the idea of rivalry. Now in other videos, we do a deep dive into what scarcity is, but just as a review, in everyday language, you could think of something is scarce, a good or a service is scarce if there's not enough for everyone. Another way to think about it is a scarce resource is one that is limited. It is a limited resource and there's not enough to go around because there are potentially unlimited wants from people. So potentially, potentially unlimited, unlimited wants. And we could think of a lot of scarce resources. Oil would be a scarce resource. There's a limited supply of oil and potentially, if oil were free, there's an unlimited amount of people who would want to use that oil. And so a lot of economics is, well, when you have a scarce resource like oil or land or housing, how do you allocate those resources amongst people, people who are demanding those resources? Now rivalry is a related idea. When we think about the everyday word rival or rivalry, you imagine multiple parties competing for something and that's essentially getting pretty close to the economics definition of it. Something is a rival good or a rival resource. I'll just call it a rival good right now if when one person uses it, it limits the ability for other people to use it. So one person consuming it or using it, consuming it limits ability for others to use. And there's a lot of examples of rival goods and things that are both scarce and rival goods. For example, if I were to put a nice, delicious cake that could only serve four people in our office here at Khan Academy where we have 80 or 90 folks work, well, you can imagine that cake's going to be a rival good. It's also a scarce good because many people, many more people are gonna want that cake than the amount of cake we have. But when you look at what the definition of a rival good is, every time if I eat the whole cake, that's going to limit other people's ability to use it. And economists will sometimes create a spectrum of how rivalrous a good is. So for example, let me draw a spectrum right over here. So on this line, so on the left-hand side, I will call this highly rivalrous, which they'll actually use that word, but I'll just call this rival goods. And then at the other extreme here, I'll say non-rival, non-rival good. And at the left end, it's pretty easy to come up with a bunch of rival goods. If you're living in a place where housing is tight, where all of the housing is taken up, housing is often a rival good. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and when a house goes on rent, you'll have multiple people who are competing for that house or if it's going for sale. And so when one person gets it and gets to live there, well, that's gonna make it hard for other people to use it. You could imagine, you know, land in a lot of urban areas is a rival good. You could imagine something like, you know, a cake, especially if there's not a lot of cake to go around at a birthday party. Now, what would be the other extreme? What would be a non-rival good? Well, there are very few perfectly non-rival goods, but there are things that are close to it because at least relative to where people's, where people are trying to use it today, it seems like there's almost an unlimited supply of it. One example might be something that's close. I'm not gonna put it all the way at the end. I'm gonna put air, air to breathe on Earth. Now, right now, it's a non-rival good. When I take a deep breath, it doesn't make it hard for you to take another simultaneous deep breath. And actually, let me put a little qualifier here, simultaneously, simultaneously. That's actually a key qualifier for a rival good. So for example, a hammer is also a rival good because if I'm using it right now, it becomes very hard for you to use it simultaneously. Now, as I mentioned, air to breathe, if I take a deep breath right now, it doesn't make it any harder for you to take a deep breath. But if you were to take an extreme circumstance that, let's say that if we were in a closed room with a limited supply of oxygen, well, then the air might become something closer to a rival good. So let me put it this way. Air to breathe outside, while here I'll put air in, airtight, let me put oxygen in an airtight container or airtight room. Oxygen in airtight room, or maybe a room that is running out of oxygen. Well, then every time I take a breath, it's gonna make it harder for you to take a breath and vice versa. There's other things like, well, roads are rival goods, especially if we're talking about rush hour. So let me put this right over here. So let's call this the roads during rush hour. Roads during rush hour. The more people that are on the roads, it's gonna make it harder for other people to use it simultaneously. We'll get all this traffic. People won't even be able to get on the highway because there's so much gridlock. But then you could imagine roads in the middle of the night are non-rival goods. If I decide to take a drive at three in the morning on most highways, it doesn't make it any harder for another person to take a drive on that highway simultaneously. So let me put it over here. Roads at 3 a.m. in most places is closer to being a non-rival good. So I will leave you there. These are ideas that we're going to keep revisiting in economics, but it's good to have a sense of what they mean, and then it'll inform how we think about allocating these scarce goods amongst folks and thinking about how we allocate these rival goods amongst various parties."
4ecf22e5-fed5-4e8b-bba5-6835d78930bd,"As we talked about in other videos, shortly after the Declaration of Independence in July of 1776, the representatives from what were colonies but now self-declared states had to think about how to organize themselves. And so they start drafting the Articles of Confederation which go into effect in 1781. Now as we'll see, these Articles of Confederation do not provide for any type of real central government. It really was a mutual defense union with a little bit of free trade, as we'll see in the text here. This is some of the beginning passages of the Articles of Confederation. And I encourage you to read the whole thing. It's actually quite interesting. But you immediately see that it has a very different tone than the one that we see in the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution starts with we the people while the Articles of Confederation starts with to all to whom these presents shall come. So it's almost kind of an awkward business letter. We the undersigned delegates of the states affixed to our names send greeting. Articles of Confederation and perpetual union between the states of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. The style of this confederacy shall be the United States of America. Each, this part is interesting, each state retains its sovereignty. So it rules over itself. It's not giving up its sovereignty to some type of a union. So it retains its sovereignty, its freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled. So they're really viewing themselves as independent countries that are next to each other that for the sake of fighting the Revolutionary War agreed to things like mutual defense and free trade, but they are really separate countries. The said states hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other for their common defense, so this is that mutual defense idea, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other against all force offered to or attacks made upon them or any of them on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretense whatever. And then it says the better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different states in this union, the free inhabitants of each of these states shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several states, and the people of each state shall free ingress and regress to and from any other state, and shall enjoy therein all the privileges of trade and commerce. So people can travel back and forth between these states, there would be free trade, but these would be viewed as different countries. One interesting thing that you don't hear people talk a lot about, there's even a little passage here that allows Canada to join this confederation. Canada, acceding to this confederation and adjoining in the measures of the United States shall be admitted into and entitled to all the advantages of this union, but no other colony shall be admitted into the same unless such admission be agreed to by nine states. So they're saying, hey, if Canada agrees, they are pre-agreeing to allow Canada to join this union, which Canada obviously does not join. But it's interesting to think that they thought about this. Now what are the weaknesses here? Well, the most obvious one, I don't have the entire Articles of Confederation here, but how does this United States of America wield its power? Where does its money come from? It turns out that if it needs to generate revenue in order to take some action, it can't tax the citizens of the states. The states can only do that themselves. Instead, it has to apply to the states in order to contribute to the United States of America. If you wanted to take some type of unified action, well, you would have to have delegates from the various states and meet together and decide what to do. You wouldn't have any strong leader being able to take decisive action. And so there really wasn't a notion of a central government here. There wasn't even a notion of one country, one nation. It really was about different sovereign states. And all of this, as we'll see, will come to a head in the mid-1780s. The United States has a significant amount of debt exiting the American Revolutionary War, debt to countries like France. You also have debt on an individual level. Merchants owe money to European merchants and traders and lenders. And these lenders weren't interested in paper currency from these newly created states. They wanted hard currency. They wanted gold and they want silver. And so many of the merchants in the United States in turn put pressure on the people they lent money to, especially poor farmers, many of whom had been veterans in the Revolutionary War, to pay their debts in hard currency. And so you can imagine these poor farmers who were kind of the bottom of this food chain were in a pretty tough mind. They had fought in the Revolutionary War. They had risked their lives. Many of them had been injured, but they actually did not get paid for their service to a large degree. And then now they were not able to even survive as farmers because not only were they not able to borrow new funds, but some of their existing funds they had to pay back in hard currency which wasn't available in the United States. And so all of this tension eventually comes to a head in Western Massachusetts. This right here is a picture of Daniel Shays who was one of these poor farmers in Western Massachusetts who was also a veteran of the American Revolutionary War who was not paid for his service. And so he eventually becomes one of the leaders of these rebellious former veterans, poor farmers, and they start taking the courthouses of Western Massachusetts, making them inoperable. These are the courthouses where people had to report to in order to talk about how they would repay their debt. Well, you can imagine this worried many of the merchants who these people owed their debt to. It also worried many of the founding fathers because it took some time for the government of Massachusetts to be able to react to this. And while that was happening through mid-1786 and into the beginning of 1787, this rebellion got stronger and stronger and stronger. Eventually, on January 25th, 1787, we see things coming to a head where Daniel Shays is leading his rebels to take the armory in Springfield, Massachusetts, which is in Western Massachusetts, but it's stopped by a militia. This is a militia that's paid for by merchants in the area who probably want their debts paid or just wanted functioning courthouses or did not want all of these rioting farmers and former veterans. And so this rebellion is put down, but it shows the weakness inherent in the Articles of Confederation. This rebellion starts having the potential to spread well beyond Massachusetts, but there was not a coordinated action. In fact, it took many months to even be able to field a militia against the rebellion. It also highlighted the weakness of not having one central government that can take decisive action, also one central government that could generate its own revenue through taxing the citizens of all of the states and using that for things like a military or being able to negotiate debts with foreign countries. And so Shays' Rebellion is cited by many historians as one of the main catalysts after it was put down for having the Constitutional Convention in mid-1787 to rethink the Articles of Confederation. Now, as we talked about in other videos, many people went to this convention thinking, we're not just gonna edit the Articles of Confederation. We need to create a stronger central government. We need a federalist system where, yes, the states can have rights, but we also need a central government. We need a strong leader at the head of that central government. And so they do draft what is now the Constitution at this convention. Then after the convention, they sell this new Constitution, because remember, it has to be ratified by the states through the Federalist Papers, which we also talk about in other videos. Hamilton organized it, but James Madison and John Jay, also significant contributors. And eventually, the Articles of Confederation does get replaced. The Constitution is ratified, and it becomes effective on March 4th, 1789."
de95aa65-b355-4dfa-a75f-8bb2271cb81a,"In the last video, we gave a bit of an overview of potassium-argon dating. In this video, I want to go through a concrete example. It'll get a little bit math-y, usually involving a little bit of algebra or a little bit of exponential decay but to really show you how you can actually figure out the age of some volcanic rock using this technique, using a little bit of mathematics. So we know that anything that is experiencing radioactive decay, it's experiencing exponential decay, and we know that we can, there's a generalized way to describe that and we go into more depth and kind of prove it in other Khan Academy videos. But we know that the amount as a function of time, so if we say n is the amount of a radioactive sample we have at some time, we know that's equal to the initial amount we have, we'll call that n sub zero, times e to the negative kt, where this constant is particular to that thing's half-life. And to figure it out, and we're gonna do this for the example of potassium-40, we know that after, when time is 1.25 billion years, that the amount we have left is half of our initial amount. So let's write it that way. So let's say when we start with n naught, we start with n naught, whatever that might be, it might be one gram, kilogram, five grams, whatever it might be, whatever we start with, we take e to the negative k times 1.25 billion years, that's the half-life of potassium-40, so 1.25 billion years, we know after that long that half of the sample will be left. So we will have 1.5 n naught left. Whatever we started with, we're going to have half left after 1.25 billion years, divide both sides by n naught, divide both sides by n naught, and then to solve for k, we can take the natural log of both sides, so you get the natural log of 1.5, we don't have that n naught there anymore, is equal to the natural log of this thing. The natural log is just saying, to what power do I have to raise e to get e to the negative k times 1.25 billion? So the natural log of this, the power that I have to raise e to to get to e to the negative k times 1.25 billion is just negative k times 1.25 billion. I could write it as negative 1.25, let me write it times 10 to the ninth, times 10 to the ninth k. That's the same thing as 1.25 billion, we have our negative sign and we have our k. And then to solve for k, we can divide both sides by negative 1.25 billion. And so we get k, and I'll just flip the sides here, k is equal to the natural log of 1.5 times negative 1.25 times 10 to the ninth power. And what we can do is we can multiply the negative times the top, or you can view it as multiplying the numerator and the denominator by a negative so that the negative shows up at the top. And so we could make this as over 1.25 times 10 to the ninth, this is 1.25 billion. And negative, let me write it over here in a different color. The negative natural log, well I could just write it this way. If I have a natural log of b, we know from our logarithm properties this is the same thing as the natural log of b to the a power. So the negative natural log of 1.5 is the same thing as the natural log of 1.5 to the negative one power. And so this is the same thing. Anything to the negative one power is just this multiplicative inverse. So this is just the natural log of two. So negative natural log of 1.5 is just the natural log of two over here. So we were able to figure out our k. It's essentially the natural log of two over the half-life of this substance. So we could actually generalize this if we were talking about some other radioactive substance. And now let's think about a situation, now that we've figured out a k, let's think about a situation where we find in some sample, so let's say the potassium that we find, let's say it is one milligram. I'm just gonna make up these numbers. And let's say, and usually these aren't measured directly and you really care about the relative amounts, but let's say you're able to figure out the potassium is one milligram, and let's say that the argon, actually, let me say the potassium 40 found, and let's say the argon 40 found, let's say it is 0.01, 0.01 milligram. So how can we use this information, what we just figured out here, which is derived from the half-life, to figure out how old this sample right over here? How do we figure out how old this sample is right over there? Well, what we need to figure out, we know that n, the amount we were left with, is this thing right over here. So we know that we're left with one milligram. So we know that what we have left is one milligram. And that's going to be equal to some initial amount, it's going to be some initial amount, and we'll use both of this information to figure that initial amount out, times e to the negative kT. And we know what k is, and we'll figure it out later. So k is this thing right over here. So we need to figure out what our initial amount is. We know what k is, and then we can solve for T. How old is this sample? And to figure out our initial amount, we just have to remember that for every argon-40 we see, that must have decayed from, when you have potassium-40, 11% decays, when it decays, 11% decays into argon-40, and the rest, 89%, decays into calcium-40. We saw that in the last video. So however much argon-40, that is 11% of the decay product. So if you want to think about the total number of potassium-40s that have decayed since this was kind of stuck in the lava, and we learned that anything that was there before, any argon-40 that was there before would have been able to get out of the liquid lava before it froze, or before it hardened. So to figure out how much potassium-40 this is derived from, we just derive it, we divide it by 11%. So maybe I could say k initial, the potassium-40 initial is going to be equal to the amount of potassium-40 we have today, one milligram, plus the amount of potassium-40 we needed to get this amount of argon-40. So we have this amount of argon-40, .01 milligrams, and that, the number of milligrams there, it's really just 11% of the original potassium-40 that it had to come from. The rest of it turned into calcium-40. So we divide it by 11%, or 0.11. And I'm doing, this isn't the exact number, but it'll get the general idea. And so our initial, which is really this thing right over here, I could call this N naught. I could call this N naught. This is going to be equal to, and I won't do any of the math, so we have one milligram we have left, is equal to one milligram, which is what we found, plus 0.01 milligram, over 0.11, and then all of that times e to the negative kt. And what you see here is, when we want to solve for t, assuming we know k, and we do know k now, that it really, the absolute amount doesn't matter. What actually matters is the ratio, because if we're solving for t, you want to divide both sides of this equation by this quantity right over here. So you get this side, the left-hand side, divide both sides, you get one milligram over this quantity, I'll write it in blue, over this quantity is going to be one plus, I'm just going to assume, actually, that the units here are milligrams. So you get one over this quantity, which is one plus 0.01 over the 11%, that is equal to e to the negative kt. And then you want to take, if you want to solve for t, you want to take the natural log of both sides. So then you get, so this is equal right over here. You want to take the natural log of both sides, so you get the natural log of one over one plus 0.01 over 0.11, or 11%, is equal to negative kt. And then to solve for t, you divide both sides by negative k. So I'll write it over here. You can see this is a little bit cumbersome mathematically, but we're getting to the answer. So we got the natural log of one over one plus 0.01 over 0.11 over negative k. Well, what is negative k? We're just dividing both sides of this equation by negative k. Negative k is the negative of this over the negative natural log of two over 1.25 times 10 to the ninth. And now we can get our calculator out and just solve for what this time is, and it's going to be in years, because that's how we figured out this constant. So let's get out my handy TI-85. And so first I'll do this part. So this is one divided by one plus 0.01 divided by 0.11. So that's this part right over here. That gives us that number. And then we want to take the natural log of that. So let's take the natural log of our, this is just our previous answer. So natural log of 0.9166667 gives us negative 0.087. So that's this numerator over here. And we're going to divide that. So this number is our numerator right over here. We're going to divide that by the negative, I'll use parentheses carefully, the negative natural log of two, that's that there, divided by 1.25 times 10 to the ninth. So it's negative natural log of two divided by 1.25. E9 means times 10 to the ninth. And I closed both parentheses. And now we need our drum roll. So this should give us our T in years. And we get, let's see how many. This is 1,000, so it's 3,000. So we get 156 million or 156.9 million years if we round. So this is approximately, or I could just say approximately 157 million years old sample. So the whole point of this, I know the math was a little bit involved. But it's something that you would actually see in kind of a pre-calculus class or an algebra 2 class when you're studying exponential growth and decay. But the whole point I want to do this is to show you that it's not some crazy voodoo here. And Sal gave this very high level explanation. And then you say, oh, well, there must be some super difficult mathematics after that. The mathematics really is something that you would see in high school. And if you saw a sample that had this ratio of argon 40 to potassium 40, you would actually be able to do that fairly high school mathematics. You would be able to do that to figure out this is 157 million year old sample of volcanic rock."
f790ff29-c0a6-4211-812a-801dc91873a5,"In this video, I'm going to use words like eras, periods, and ages to refer to segments of time in the human or in the pre-human past. And what I want to clarify right from the get-go, because frankly this is something that's confused me in the past, is that archaeologists will refer to eras, periods, and ages in the human past, and they're usually referring to periods of tens of thousands of years or thousands of years. But these are different eras, periods, and ages than the ones that geologists would refer to when they're talking about geological time. In geological time, era means several hundred millions of years. Periods and ages mean millions of years. When archaeologists, when we're starting the human past, they're just generally talking about long segments of human time, but not in the millions of years, usually in the thousands or the 10,000s of years. So what I want to do with that out of the way is talk about what has happened in the distant human past or the distant pre-human past, and also touch on some of the classifications for these segments of time, because they actually tell us what were the interesting developments that happened to humanity over the 200,000 years that Homo sapiens have been on this planet, or that we believe that Homo sapiens have been on this planet. So the longest period of time in human past, or the category of human time, and there's different ways you can categorize it, is the Paleolithic Era right over here, and what really makes that period of time. So this begins even in pre-history or pre-human history, so before Homo sapiens even existed, you have the beginning of the Paleolithic Era that really began with the development of stone tools, and as we learned in the video on human evolution, there were pre- Homo sapiens species that were using stone tools. And so the Paleolithic Era, it's really kind of signified by, one, the stone tools, but even more, that either the pre-humans, or once you go about 200,000 years ago, the humans showed up, it's kind of distinguished by humans being hunter-gatherers, which essentially means to survive. We used to walk around a lot, if we couldn't see something obvious to hunt, maybe a woolly mammoth or something, if we didn't see something obvious to hunt, we would look around for snails or mushrooms or whatever else, and that's how we would survive, that's how we would live. And because we were constantly adapting to our environment based on the seasons, we were maybe following animals as they migrated, hunter-gatherers were fundamentally nomadic, which means that they never settled in one place for a long time. They were always ready to kind of pick up, probably, their tents and follow the herd, or follow whatever animals they were hunting, or follow the seasons so they could go to warmer climates, maybe where there's more likely to find on the ground to eat, maybe, during the winter, or who knows. And so the Paleolithic Era is really distinguished by that. It's a huge swath of time in human history, and it doesn't come to an end until you get to the advent of farming. So the Paleolithic Era, I mean, we're literally talking about over 2 million years ago is when it starts, before Homo sapiens even existed as a species, and it goes all the way to the advent of farming that we believe first came about around 11,000 to 7,000 years ago. And this abbreviation right here, this BP, this does not stand for British Petroleum. It stands for Before Present, or Before the Present Time. So one more acronym to kind of have in your toolkit when you see things. And obviously, if we're 11,000 years before the present, that's the same thing as 9,000 years before Christ, or before the Common Era, because Christ was, we believe, born 2,000 years ago. Now, it may or may not be obvious to you, but the advent of agriculture is a super big deal. Arguably, the biggest deal in the development of human civilization, or in all of human history. And you might say, hey, what's the big deal about agriculture? These characters over here look pretty happy. They're able to walk around a lot. They're able to hunt. What's the big deal of all of a sudden people plowing fields and domesticating cattle and having chickens to lay eggs and whatever else? And the big deal about that, besides the fact that it would change people's diet, is that for the first time, it allowed them to not be nomadic. And you could have probably had some hunters who were somewhat settled, maybe living near the ocean. Maybe they did some fishing and all the rest. But for the most part, with the development of agriculture, it forced people to stay in one place. So you have the Paleolithic era all the way to the advent of agriculture, which was about 11,000 to 7,000 years ago, and besides the fact that it changed people's diet, it allowed them to settle. So agriculture allowed human beings to settle down in one area. And it wasn't just that they were settling in one area, but because they were able to control their environment. They were able to increase the density of things, of crops that humans could consume, and animals that humans could consume, and lower the density of crops that humans can't consume, and animals that they can't consume, or that they don't want around, like pests of some type. What it allowed them to do is also settle in more dense environments. You can imagine, when you just have people walking around, you need a lot of land to support even the calorie requirements of one human being. But all of a sudden, if you are able to develop agriculture, you're able to domesticate animals, all of a sudden you can have, in the same amount of land, you can have more calories being generated. And because you have more calories being generated in a smaller amount of land, people can settle, and they can settle in a denser environment. And so agriculture was really this necessary requirement for people to kind of develop civilization, or to develop villages, and cities, and maybe also giving them the free time to start thinking about, hey, maybe we want to think about how we can record what we know, how we can develop even more technologies. And so just to give us a sense of the categorization that an archaeologist would use for these different periods of time, I told you we start with the Paleolithic era, with the advent of stone tools, pre-humans, most of human time on this planet, and then about 11,000 years ago, the development of agriculture, and it developed independently at different places around the world, which is by itself an interesting phenomenon. People think that it might just be that the climate might have warmed up a little bit, so that people, maybe naturally there were some human edible crops that existed in a little bit of a denser environment, and humans learned to optimize that slowly, and they did that independently. But it's an interesting question of why did it develop just then, after 180,000, 190,000 years, why did agriculture all of a sudden happen? But just to get the terminology, the Paleolithic era is that period before agriculture, and then once agriculture starts developing, we are now in the Neolithic era, and some archaeologists will describe a transition period between the Paleolithic and the Neolithic era, called the Mesolithic. And just so you know what these words mean, because they actually make sense when you know what they mean, paleo means old, and lithic means stone, or of stone, so they're really talking about the old stone age. Neolithic, as you can imagine, means new, new stone, so it's kind of the new stone age, and meso means middle, so it is the middle, it is the middle stone age. So another way of thinking about this whole period, from when people were hunter-gatherers all the way to about 11,000 to 7,000 years ago when they developed agriculture, this whole period is called the stone age, and the stone age is kind of this biggest age, and there's just different ways of describing it, because if you just call the stone age, you're really making importance out of the actual tools that people could shape. They weren't able to use metal at this point. When you refer to Paleolithic and Neolithic, you're maybe referring a little bit more, and there's other ways to think about it, but you're referring a little bit more to the lifestyles of the human beings, Paleolithic being hunter-gatherers, Neolithic having actually settled, having actually started to develop kind of primitive villages and even cities, and then, of course, Mesolithic is in between, and just for kind of a pop culture reference, you might have heard of the Paleolithic diet that some people are going on now, and those are people who try to live like hunter-gatherers. Their belief is that most of human evolution occurred while we were hunter-gatherers, and so that's what our bodies are most accustomed to, so they like to eat meat, and they like to eat a lot of nuts, and I even met a co-worker once who used to only eat raw meat, and I don't know if that is even justified or that's even somehow validated by the archaeological record. These people probably did cook their meat. Now, at the end of the Stone Age, we would have, I would say, the number two most significant development in human history, and now we're talking about 3,000 BC, which is about 5,000 years ago, and this is the development of writing. So we were hunter-gatherers about 9,000 to 10,000, 11,000 years ago. People start developing agriculture. It allows them to settle in more dense environments. It also gives them a little bit more free time because they don't have to hunt and gather all the time, and then you go, and once again, we'll probably discover things as we go forward in time that maybe these dates need to be pushed back or whatever else, or we discover new civilizations or who knows, but our best sense is you have these villages, you have these civilizations developing, and by about 5,000 years ago, so this would be 5,000 before the present or 3,000 BC before Christ, you have people saying, hey, why don't we start trying to write down what we know so that when I tell someone orally, it doesn't actually lose information there and so our descendants can slowly collect all of the knowledge we have and maybe accelerate, I don't know if they did it explicitly thinking of these, but let's just write down what we know, and so at about that period of time, you have, as far as we can tell, the first development of kind of a pictogram-based system of writing, and the earliest system of writing we know is cuneiform, which is from the Sumerian civilization, which is now in present-day Iraq, and what's the really big deal about this is that this is, on some level, the beginning of recorded history. We could talk about the word history. You could say that history is all of the past, and we could use the archaeological record to figure out stuff before people started to write things down, but when they started to write things down, now it was recorded. Now we're actually getting actual accounts of what people know, of actual people's knowledge, and the reason why this is a big deal, I mean, agriculture, hopefully you now appreciate that it was a pretty big deal, but the reason why writing was a big deal is that now civilization could collect its knowledge, and it could build upon it generation after generation without having to worry about people forgetting it, or information getting distorted verbally from ancestor to descendant, and with that, you also have the beginning of the Bronze Age, and the Bronze Age is kind of known for this beginning of, even though it's referring to a material, which comes from the first time that people started using bronze as a tool, or using bronze for their tools and for their weapons, and bronze, just you know, it's a mixture of mostly copper and a little bit of tin, but the Bronze Age, at least in my mind, the biggest deal of what started at the beginning of the Bronze Age really, really was the writing. So once again, just as a review, because I actually, I don't know, I find this kind of confusing, our current understanding, most of human prehistory, and even pre-human prehistory, were spent as hunter-gatherers using stone tools until about 11,000 years ago, and then we became a little bit more settled, we became farmers, essentially, using stone tools, and then you fast-forward another about 5,000, 6,000 years, and then we started to become farmers who started to write down the things that we knew, and we started to use bronze tools."
d87b9bca-b597-4745-b211-812d612ca435,"Hey, this is Kim from Khan Academy, and today I'm learning about Article Five of the U.S. Constitution, which describes the Constitution's amendment process. To learn more about Article Five, I talked to two experts, Professor Michael Rappaport, who is the Darling Foundation Professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, where he also serves as the Director of the Center for the Study of Constitutional Originalism, and David Strauss, who's the Gerald Ratner Distinguished Service Professor of Law at the University of Chicago Law School, and author of The Living Constitution. Professor Strauss, Article Five provides this process for amending the Constitution. Can you take us through that process a little bit? How does it work? The quick description of the process is it's really hard. It's really hard to amend the Constitution. There are actually a couple of different processes that are laid out in Article Five, but only one has ever been used. Amendment starts in Congress, and two-thirds of each house of Congress, two-thirds of the House of Representatives, and two-thirds of the Senate has to approve the amendment. And then it goes to the states, and three-quarters of the states have to approve the amendment. So you have to have a really strong consensus in order to get the Constitution changed that way. So, Professor Rappaport, take us through this process of amending the Constitution. Why did the framers set it up this way? The framers gave a good bit of thought to coming up with an amendment process, because they recognized that the Constitution might need to be changed over time, either because there were problems with it that weren't anticipated, or because circumstances or values changed. So there are two steps to the amendment process. For an amendment to go into the Constitution, to become part of the Constitution, it has to be both proposed and ratified. On the proposal side, the Congress can propose. Alternatively, a proposal can come from the action of the state legislatures. So two-thirds of the state legislatures say, we'd like to have a constitutional convention propose an amendment. So there's two parts of that, obviously. The state legislatures have got to want it, and then you get a calling of a constitutional convention. Okay, that's the proposal side. There's also the ratification side, which is a little bit simpler. You need three-quarters of the states to ratify a constitutional amendment. And they can ratify it either through the actions of the state legislatures, or the actions of state conventions, which are special bodies which would be elected in order to decide one question, whether or not to ratify that proposed constitutional amendment. This is fascinating. So I actually had no idea about the two-thirds of the state legislatures being able to propose a constitutional amendment. How often does that happen? It has never occurred throughout our history, although a couple of times, there were actions taken to sort of move in that direction. But we've never actually had a constitutional convention that has proposed any amendments. It's important to go into why the framers would have set up the system the way they did. The most usual situation is for the Congress to propose the amendments, and that's happened in all of the 27 amendments, which have been ratified to become part of our Constitution. But what happens if the Congress is the problem? What happens if the Congress is doing, is usurping power, or they're standing in the way of changes that are important, or they need to be reformed? You can't count on the Congress to wanna reform itself. So what they did was to have this alternative mechanism, which would bypass the Congress. And that alternative mechanism was the Constitutional Convention. So the state-led legislatures propose, apply for it. And then the separate entity, the Constitutional Convention, makes a proposal. So they were quite explicit in discussing this, that they wanted this as an alternative to the Congress. So was this on purpose, that they made it very difficult to amend the Constitution? Well, it sure seems like it. Now, of course, we don't know back then what they had in mind, whether they thought, well, the House, the Senate, the states, they'll sort of all be run by the same kind of people, and they'll kind of agree on things. Maybe they thought that, we just don't know. But whatever they were thinking, what they gave us, was a very difficult process to get through. So how long was it from the period when the Constitution was first ratified to the first amendment to the Constitution beyond the Bill of Rights? Okay, so the first 10 amendments were ratified in 1791. And then, just a mere three years later, we had the 11th Amendment. And there was an 11th Amendment in 1798 to correct really kind of a technical problem that the Supreme Court did something that the framers really didn't anticipate it would do, didn't want it to do, and the 11th Amendment was adopted to correct that. The 12th Amendment was adopted in 1804 after the really kind of a disaster in the election of 1800 when there was a tie in the Electoral College. The framers had not foreseen the rise of political parties and political parties made the system for electing the president they had given us very difficult to work with. But then there was nothing, that was 1804, then there was nothing until after the Civil War. And after the Civil War, there were three amendments, then nothing again, really, until the Progressive Era in the early 20th century when there were again a bunch of amendments. And then after then, things had sort of paled off. So we really see these kind of, as I said, these kind of waves in our history. What do you think brings those waves on? Why are there some eras when there are lots of constitutional amendments and other eras when there's nothing? Well, Kim, here I'm gonna say something that I think some people will disagree with, but I think it's right. And that is that I don't think the process of amending the Constitution has really been the way we actually change it. I think what happens is, just because the amendment process is so difficult, we've worked out other ways of changing things. And so amendments come along sometimes because a change has already happened and people decide, well, let's put it in the Constitution just so we can kind of have official recognition of it. But a lot of times changes happen and they're a little bit too controversial to get into the Constitution, but they seem pretty solid and pretty secure. So we just don't, I guess it's fair to say, don't bother to amend the Constitution or don't wanna go through the process of amending the Constitution. Very often people's values may change or they may differ from what's in the Constitution. And it may take a time or circumstances may finally occur that crystallize this desire to change the Constitution. And all of a sudden the opportunity is there and people can suddenly pass a constitutional amendment. It's only gonna occur during certain circumstances, especially when there's strong support for it. Very interesting, yeah. So it's unlikely that we're gonna have a constitutional amendment anytime in the near future. When was the last constitutional amendment? So the simple answer to that was in 1971, we got the 26th amendment that was both proposed and then remarkably, it's all time record, proposed and ratified in three months and eight days. And that was the amendment that guaranteed the right to vote of 18 year old. Ah, right. So sort of as a response to the Vietnam War. Yes, yes. But there actually has been one additional amendment, the 27th amendment, right? So why isn't that the most recent one? Well, here's the funny thing about it. The 27th amendment was proposed as part of the original Bill of Rights in 1789. So this amendment was proposed in 1789, ratified in 1992. So it took 202 years. Interesting, and what's the 27th amendment about? That has to do with congressional salary increases. It basically says if Congress wants to raise its own salary, the increase can't take effect until the next election. So it basically gives the voters a chance to say, hey, we don't like what you did. We're gonna vote you out of office for increasing your salary. So one thing that strikes me about Article V and just the fact that the founders included an amendment process altogether, it seems very humble and farsighted to include a way for the document itself to evolve in a way. Do you think that the framers approached the constitution with the idea that there were things in the future that they just wouldn't be able to anticipate? They had before them and were acutely aware of a history in which efforts to establish governments had failed. And they were really trying to work with that and make sure they didn't do the same thing. So they knew what a hard job they were embarking on. And they made it clear. I mean, there's a famous passage in which James Madison said, look, we know a lot of these provisions that we're writing in the constitution, their meaning is unclear. And their meaning will have to be, his phrase was liquidated, which is to say, people have to figure out what this means because we know what we're giving you is unclear in some ways. So yes, absolutely. They knew there were things that they could not anticipate. The framers themselves weren't in agreement on what freedom of speech means. Some of them enacted, voted for, and got into, enacted laws that restricted speech in ways that we would find intolerable today. We'd say they violate the First Amendment. But here you had some of the guys who drafted the First Amendment voting for those laws. So near the end of Article V, there's this kind of long-winded clause that says, no amendment which may be made prior to the year 1808 shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article. Now, if I'm cross-referencing this correctly, what they're really saying here is, you can't make any amendments about slavery. So why is this here? And why are they talking around it so obliquely? The interesting thing about this is, what did they do? They basically said, for 20 years, there's not gonna be any amendments that are going to speak to the slave trade. And the Constitution is very, let us say, shy about using the term slavery or referring to slavery. It actually never actually refers to the term slave. There's a variety of thoughts about what was going on, but one very common view about this is that the Constitution was sort of a little bit embarrassed that the framers were a little bit embarrassed, or at least some of the framers were embarrassed about it. And so they didn't wanna make reference to it too explicitly. They might've been a little bit worried about what the verdict of history would be. So they knew on some level, the sort of immorality of slavery, but there it is right there in Article V, and there are other places in the Constitution, too, where they don't use the word, but what they're doing is protecting slavery. Now, they did add these amendments to the Constitution about slavery and about, as you say, equal citizenship and voting, but the 14th Amendment providing equal citizenship, that was pretty much nullified in most respects for a large part of our history. States found a way to get around that. The 15th Amendment was also something that was just not very effective in preventing African-Americans from being denied the vote. And yes, there are provisions in the Constitution that are there, and you can invoke them, and you can rely on them, but if you just look at the text of the Constitution, I think you get a misleading impression about how the Constitution in our history has actually worked. Now, this is a very good point, because I think one of the hardest things for students of US history to understand is, how is it possible that after the 14th Amendment was passed, things like Jim Crow happened? And I guess the answer is, the Constitution is only in force if it's enforced. Kim, that's exactly right. It's words on a page. You know, the text is fine, it can say all the right things, but the institutions and the popular will have to be in place to make something of those fine words. Interesting, so how do you think our government might be different if the Constitution didn't include this amendment process? I don't think it would have been that different. Just because Article V gives us such a hard process to go through, just because it's so hard to amend the Constitution, we figured out other ways to change the Constitution in practice, even if the words on the page are the same. And I think if there were no Article V, we would have found a way to get to where we wanted to get to as a country, by those means, by legislation, by presidential action, by Supreme Court decision, and just by the people in their lives saying, you know, we need to go in this direction. We need to go, say, in the direction of women's equality. And by the way, there's no amendment giving women equal rights either, but that's where we've gotten to. And I think that would have been the pattern if there were no formal amendment process. There's a second way in which you could have constitutional change, which is you could simply say, all right, this Constitution was pretty good for a while. It's now outlived its usefulness. Let's have a new Constitution. That would seem like a very radical, big thing to do. No one, virtually no one proposes that at the federal level, but in the states, lots of states have changed their constitutions, not simply passed the constitutional amendment, but just gotten rid of the whole old Constitution and adopted a new one. That's happened many times. And so if we didn't have a constitutional amendment process, it's quite possible that that's exactly what we would have seen at the federal level. Yeah, this is really fascinating because we really think a lot about what the framers intended for certain amendments, for example, freedom of speech, freedom of religion. What did they really mean by those things? But if we had just kind of every now and again said, okay, we're done with that. Let's do a new Constitution. We wouldn't necessarily have that debate. We just say, okay, this is what we meant at the time. Famously, Thomas Jefferson said, it's really not right to have a Constitution that's gonna continue over time and bind future generations. And so we ought to have a new Constitution every 19 years when there's a new generation. And his close friend, James Madison, had to disagree with him and basically said, look, I understand why you're saying that, but you also have to realize the incredible disruption that would cause every 20 years. People wouldn't be able to rely on the existing rights that are in the Constitution because they would know in a certain period of time, new ones would be enacted. We had that debate. Madison won in the sense that the U.S. Constitution is supposed to last for a long-term period. There's no 20-year limit on it. And one of the things that's been beneficial for the United States as a result of that is that we've inherited these constitutional rights that people have a lot of reverence for. So we've learned that there are two ways to amend the Constitution, through Congress or through a special constitutional convention called by the states. Either way, adding an amendment to the Constitution is really difficult to do, so much so that the American people have only in special circumstances used a constitutional amendment to affect social or political change.

4f218008-c4d8-41a8-9036-be2ed56fa437,"In our study of the different types of markets, we are now going to dive a little bit deeper and understand perfect competition. Now this notion of something being perfectly competitive, you might have a general idea of what it means. You might feel like it's very competitive, that there's a lot of people there maybe competing for your business, or maybe there's a lot of buyers and there are a lot of sellers. And that is generally true, but we're trying to be economists here, so we wanna be very precise with our language. So when economists talk about perfect competition, they're talking about this somewhat very abstract state where you have many buyers and sellers, many sellers and buyers. Now that doesn't seem too abstract so far. We can imagine a lot of markets that have many sellers and buyers. Now another thing that defines perfect competition from an economics point of view is that they're selling identical products or services. Products, products or services. Now this one seems a little bit harder because even when you can imagine a fairly competitive market, does everyone sell exactly the same thing? Well you can imagine certain markets, maybe the market for water, or maybe the market for some type of energy, or maybe the market for produce gets pretty close to identical products or services. So so far it doesn't seem like that abstract of a thing. Now another aspect of perfect competition is that every agent, so that would be the buyers, the sellers, the producers, the consumers, they have perfect information. Perfect information. Now what does perfect information mean? It means that every participant in the market, the buyers and the sellers, they all know exactly what is happening in the market. So what goods or services are selling for what price and who is selling to whom? So once again, this gets a little bit more abstract because to get truly perfect information, you can't, not everyone in a market will always know everything that's going on. So once again, this is a little bit of an abstract idea that economists have introduced to be a little bit more precise. And the last aspect we're going to talk about, and this is also something that is a bit idealized, it doesn't truly exist in the real world, things close to this exist in the real world, is that there's no barriers, barriers to entry or exit. Now we already mentioned some markets, say the market for agriculture. That doesn't quite have no barriers to entry or exit. You would somehow have to get land, you would have to get seeds, you would have to get fertilizer, you would have to hire people to put the seeds in and to harvest the crops. And so almost any industry, any market you imagine will have some barriers. But this is an idealized notion that economists like to think about. And of course, in the real world, things might approach this or be closer to perfect competition than say other markets. But when you are in this situation, let's analyze what will be happening. So we can look at the market as a whole for whatever this product and service is. So let me draw price versus quantity here for the market as a whole. So this is price, and this is quantity, and this is the market right over here. And so we've seen this multiple times in our economics journey, that you have an upward sloping supply curve. And once again, this is for the entire market. Let me do this in a different color. So you have an upward sloping supply curve like that. And you would have a downward sloping demand curve like that. And we know what the equilibrium price and quantity would be for the market. So this right over here would be the equilibrium quantity for the market. And this right over here would be the equilibrium price for the market. Now, how would this affect the decisions for the firm in perfect competition? Well, let's draw a similar analysis, but now at the firm level. So on this axis, you could view this for the firm. And so this is going to be the firm right over here, one of the participants in the perfect competition, one of the producers, one of the sellers. So on this axis, you could view this as price. You could also view this as marginal revenue. And you could also view this as marginal cost because we're going to plot different curves here. And then on the horizontal axis, we're going to have quantity again. But this is, once again, the quantity that the firm produces. Now, first of all, we could think about the marginal cost for the firm. And we've seen this multiple times, that the marginal cost for the firm, it might look something like this. It, over time, might trend upwards something like this, where at some point, every incremental unit is costing more and more to produce. Maybe it's harder to get the resources, harder to get the labor, whatever you want to say. So that's the marginal cost curve, fairly typical for a firm. And then we could think about their average total cost. And so the average total cost curve might look something like this. Let's draw it something like this. So our average total cost, we've seen this multiple times. Now, what is going to be the marginal revenue for this firm that is operating in perfect competition? Well, when it's operating in perfect competition, it just has to be a price taker. So every unit it sells, it's just going to get the market price for that unit. So in perfect competition, the firm, every participant that is really identical in a lot of ways, they're just going to take that price. Think about it. They won't be able to charge any more for their product or service than the market price because their product or service is identical to everyone else's, and everyone knows it because of perfect information, and they would have no motivation to charge less either. They're just passive. You could view it that way when it comes to price. So if we just take this market price across, just like that, this right over here, this price is going to define the marginal revenue curve for that firm. So let me make this a bold curve right over here. This is going to be the marginal revenue for the firm. For every unit it sells on the margin, that's how much more revenue it's going to get. Now, you could also view this as the demand curve for the firm's product. You could also view this as the average revenue for the firm's product, and let me make this clear. This is for the firm, demand for the firm, which is equal to the price that the firm actually gets. So the big takeaway here is in perfect competition, which is this somewhat idealized state that doesn't quite exist in the real world. Certain markets can approach it. The firms are passive price takers. They have no say on what the price is going to be, and so it would be rational for them to just produce where their marginal cost intersects with their marginal revenue, because anything more than that, then for every incremental unit, they're going to be spending more money than they get in terms of revenue. And this passivity goes a little bit against some of our everyday notions of fierce competition. When we think about fierce competition, we often think about many players trying to constantly undercut each other, and in future videos, we'll talk about scenarios where that might happen. And you might think about whether or not you would want certain markets to have perfect competition, because no barriers to entry means that, frankly, anybody could get into that industry. So for example, you might not want perfect competition when it comes to someone being, say, your doctor, because you want barriers to entry. You want some level of training. You want some level of experience before someone gets into that service."
3dd9e9d5-df12-4e8d-85ab-487d016a3b76,"Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course Literature, and today we'll be doubling, bubbling, toiling, and troubling as we continue our discussion of Macbeth. Today we'll be looking more closely at the characters of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, as well as discussing the play's treatment of gender roles, and the question of whether life is just a tale told by an idiot. INTRO So one of the most remarkable things about Macbeth is that it presents us with a hero who is also a villain. Like, as we discussed last time, when we first meet Macbeth, he's just helped win a major battle for Scotland. The first time he's mentioned, a sergeant introduces him as Brave Macbeth, and being brave and winning battles were two of the major signs of great mandom at the time. Now, yes, this Macbeth is already a bit violent. He does slice an opponent down the middle and spike his head on the battlements. But he's definitely still the hero of the day, and Duncan, the king, rewards him. And at the beginning of the play, I think Shakespeare wants us to be on Macbeth's side, and we stay on his side when he has a lot of second thoughts about his wife's plan to kill the king. Basically, his wife has to talk him into it, and she does that by attacking his masculinity, but more on that later. I think, though, that our sympathies mostly stay with Macbeth even after the murder. We worry that someone is going to find him out, maybe the same someone who's knocking so relentlessly on the gate, and we hope he gets away with it, even though we know it's horrible. Like, one of the ways Shakespeare gets us to empathize with Macbeth is by showing just how conflicted he is about this whole king-killing thing. I mean, it literally sickens him. But then, once he becomes king, his paranoia kicks in, and so does his cruelty. He starts ordering more murders, maybe even some that he doesn't have to order, like that of Banquo. And now he's the one encouraging murders, not his wife. He's gone from being a hero at the start of the play to being very much the anti-hero, a journey that has since been undertaken by everyone from Walter White to Tony Soprano to Pablo Escobar to Don Draper to Jamie Lannister to that Hannibal Lecter guy in Westworld. I wonder if it's a coincidence that all those dudes are dudes. Probably not. But before we get there, let's examine how to understand Macbeth's choices in the Thought Bubble. Could we argue that Macbeth's encounter with the witches has made him evil? I mean, there's no suggestion that they've enchanted him, and they never tell him to kill Duncan or even suggest that killing Duncan is a possibility. They let Macbeth and his wife figure that part out for themselves, along with all the blood and the daggers. But the witches do light up his ambition with their prophecies. Now, maybe Macbeth has been a terrible guy from the get-go, a thane who just needed the excuse of the witches' prophecies to act on his worst impulses. As we saw, there are signs of his cruelty even from the beginning. Splitting open opponents from neck to belly is not the work of an especially meek and mild person. But then, if Macbeth is inherently evil in the manner of some Shakespeare villains, then why do his actions trouble him so much? Almost immediately, Macbeth loses the ability to pray and sleep, and he even seems to envy Duncan. After life's fitful fever, he sleeps well. Meanwhile, Macbeth is an insomniac. He also doesn't seem to enjoy being king, a job he was literally willing to kill for. And whether he actually sees Banquo's ghost in the banquet scene or just hallucinates him, neither suggests a man who is happy in his life choices. A sociopathic villain, like I'd argue Iago is in Othello, just wouldn't be haunted in that way. But for a guy who maybe isn't evil to begin with, he does keep getting a lot of people murdered. Or maybe, seeing that the murder of Duncan has already damned him for eternity, he figures there's no point repenting now. As he says to his wife, Basically, if you're already midway through fording the river of blood, shouldn't you just go ahead and cross over to the other side? Thanks, Thought Bubble. So that is actually a really interesting theological question. If you've done something that's so terrible that it can't be forgiven, that you are already damned for all eternity, what is the point of even trying to be good? That question was much explored in Shakespeare's time and is related to the question of predestination. Can we do things that are so bad that they're unforgivable, or is forgiveness always available to all humans? As usual when it comes to Shakespeare's theology, he asks the question without offering an answer, which in 17th century England was a good strategy. But however we understand Macbeth, by the midpoint of the play, probably around when he orders the murder of Banquo and his son, we've mostly stopped rooting for Macbeth and his wife to get away with their crimes. Instead, we're hoping they'll get their comeuppance, preferably before Macduff's wife and kids are brutally murdered in front of us. But alas, Shakespeare keeps the violence offstage until that scene and then allows it full reign, which should shake anyone who still feels sympathy for Macbeth. Even the witches now acknowledge his evil. The next time he approaches them, they say, Something wicked this way comes. And as for Nameless Lady Macbeth, Hollinshead, the author of the play's source material, describes her as She's the one spurring Macbeth on to murder when he's reluctant or frightened or listening to his conscience. In her opinion, at least early in the play, stabbing a king is no big deal. She even offers to go frame the guards by smearing them with Duncan's blood, saying, And it's interesting to note the opposite effect the murder has on each of them. It hardens Macbeth into a serial murderer, but it softens Lady Macbeth into a victim. Her mind becomes disturbed, she begins to sleepwalk, miming, washing her hands over and over, desperate for that little water that will clear her of the deed. But even endless water and washing can't get the spot of blood out, even after it's visibly gone. It's often been said that Lady Macbeth is the first character in English literature to have obsessive-compulsive disorder, and I have to say, as someone with OCD, that I can certainly see some similarities. Except for the record, I have never encouraged my spouse to kill the king of Scotland. Or anyone. To understand more about this dynamic, let's look at how the play treats masculinity and femininity. This tragedy has a particular interest in what it means to be a man, but we get our first taste of this by characters who don't really seem male or female, the witches. Banquo says to them, These are the Weird Sisters, which may be a corruption of the Wayward Sisters, and there's definitely a suggestion that characters who aren't identifiable as either male or female are destabilizing and upsetting. And this was certainly a period that oppressed gender fluidity, even though it's worth noting that theater was a place of gender complexity, since male actors played female roles, and Shakespeare's characters often play with traditional gender constructions. But we get another taste of how the play imagines masculinity when Lady Macbeth reads her husband's letter and starts worrying that he won't be man enough to get himself the crown. Knowing that he'll need her help, she calls on spirits to unsex her. Make thick my blood, stop up the access and passage to remorse, that no compunctions visiting of nature shall my fell purpose, nor keep peace between the effect and it. Come to my woman's breast and take my milk for gall. Okay, wow, so Lady Macbeth is saying, stop me from menstruating, stop me from lactating, basically take everything about me that is liquid and feminine and pliable and make me hard and cruel. When Macbeth tells her he's not going to kill the king, she tells him he's unmanly. When you durst do it, then you were a man, she says. And then it gets worse. She says that she's breastfed children, where those children have gone is the sort of problem that gives literary scholars fits, and loved those children, but that she would happily, quote, have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums and dashed the brains out, had I so sworn as you have done to this. Again, wow. And just a cool poetic meter note here, when they're having these kinds of arguments, especially the one about killing Duncan, many of Macbeth's lines have so-called feminine endings, which means an extra syllable in the line, and Lady Macbeth's don't. So far, the play seems to be suggesting that there's something cruel and almost unnatural about masculinity, about this idea of manning up. And maybe we can see this as another reason why Macbeth gets so murdery. Having committed to such a hard and unyielding version of masculinity, like the kind his wife offers, he doesn't really know how to soften again. But that is not the only vision of masculinity that the play provides. There's a scene between Malcolm and Macduff, where Malcolm tries to brag that he's really evil and greedy and lecherous, but then he takes it all back, suggesting that it's his innocence and even his virginity, his unmanliness, that will actually make him an honorable king. And in that same scene, Macduff learns that his wife and all of his children have been murdered, and nice virginal Malcolm tries to tell him Lady Macbeth-style to man up, dispute it like a man, Malcolm says. But here's the difference between Macduff and Macbeth. Instead of going along with this toxic vision of masculinity, Macduff finds another way. He says, Macduff, you'll recall, is not of woman born, so you could argue he's the manliest of anyone in the play. And his definition of manliness is different. It involves fighting, but it also involves feeling and loving and mourning. Of course, none of that stops him from decapitating Macbeth in the end, but Macbeth deserves it. And let's take a quick look at that ending. So before the final battle, Macbeth receives the news that his wife has died, and he recites a soliloquy, saying that To him, now, life means nothing. Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Those beautifully written, if somewhat nihilistic, lines have resonated through the last 400 years. Faulkner titled his most famous book after them. Here at the end, Macbeth doesn't seem anything like the Thane we met at the beginning of the play. He doesn't seem worried or brave or ambitious or bloodthirsty. He just seems tired. The dagger, the line of kings, Banquo's ghost, even his wife's death, none of it matters. And yet, he doesn't let that stop him from going on one last murderous rampage before his own death. His humanity just seems gone, and it's almost as though he'd like someone to stop him. But he can't bring himself to commit suicide, and he's worried that no one equals him in battle. But then, there is the surprise of Macduff, the C-section baby. But what I find fascinating is that even here at this revelation, Macbeth is still worrying about his manliness, saying, Accursed be that tongue that tells me so, for it hath cowed my better part of man. Grieving Macduff, meanwhile, is much more worried about cutting off Macbeth's head, which he does. Then, of course, being a Shakespearean tragedy, there must be a fond farewell, which comes from Malcolm, who talks about the dead butcher and his fiend-like queen. But none of those words, not dead, not butcher, not fiend-like, and not queen, describe the Macbeth and Lady Macbeth we meet early in the play. It's a short play that charts two extraordinary transformations of character. And at the end, we still don't know if Macbeth's fall was inevitable, even divinely ordained, or whether he brought it on himself through his choices. Macbeth, both the play and the man, is complicated, just like the world that shaped them. But one of the reasons Shakespeare's plays have hung around is because the best characters in them aren't one thing or another. They aren't only good or only evil. They aren't only ambitious or only meek, only weak or only strong. Macbeth endures because ambition and its cost endure, and because we are still asking that old question, Was I doomed to this, or did I choose it? Thanks for watching. We'll see you next week.

1ad54057-454f-4333-a9be-26abd676b7f1,"When we use the word value, we're usually trying to describe something's worth, importance, or usefulness to us. I value your opinion. That's nice. That hat seems like a great value for the price. Cha-ching! He had nothing of value to say, and completely talked over the professor the whole time. Rude. When it comes to entrepreneurship, value is everything. Value is the core of any business, and it directs all future decisions, innovations, and customers that get targeted. Even if we've thought about the big picture, if we can't explain how an idea makes someone's life better, then why should anyone pay attention? So let's talk strategies to answer the two fundamental questions at the core of any business model. What value do I deliver? And who are my customers? I'm Anna Akana, and this is Crash Course Business Entrepreneurship. Sometimes business jargon can seem confusing, but here's the trick. The words usually have pretty literal meanings. Since value means worth, a value proposition is the worth that you offer to your customers. Typically, a value proposition is a sentence or paragraph that clearly articulates what your service, business, or organization does, who it brings value to, and why it's valuable for those people. It should be clear why someone should choose your company over the competition. Value can be something tangible, like offering products at a lower price or higher quality, or something more abstract, like better customer service. For example, Slack is a messaging app designed to reduce email and streamline team communication, or in their words, make work life simpler, more pleasant, and more productive. Slack states the value for the customer right up front with their value proposition, be more productive at work with less effort. Without thinking about value, we risk developing something that customers don't need or want. Cheetos lip balm, anyone? No takers? Are you sure? Alright. And don't get me wrong, creating a value proposition can seem daunting. We have to be confident in ourselves and the work that we've done to develop our ideas. So what are you worth? Excuse me? What are you worth? Like, what's your value? Why should people care about you and your work? Uh, I guess I tell stories with my art that help people find meaning and feel less alone. But also, how do you even judge the value of a movie or a song or a YouTube video or any art, you know? When we write a value proposition, we have to think about two main things. First, the experiences of our customers, and second, the capabilities of our product or service. If we've got those down, it'll basically write itself. To make sure we're covering our bases, we can use the value proposition canvas created by a company called Strategizer. Half of the work is understanding customers. Gotta catch em all! And to do that, there are three main questions to ask. Number one, what are their jobs? And this is a little confusing, because I don't mean, like, their literal jobs. More like, what do they do at work and in everyday life, and what problems do they have? Number two, what pains do they experience? Like risks, obstacles, or bad outcomes? And number three, what positive gains are they looking for and receiving? Everyone is trying to maximize gains and minimize pains, or at least strike a healthy balance. So we entrepreneurs can try to tip the scales towards gains. After considering the customer experience, we can turn the spotlight onto our potential business with three response questions. Number one, what products and services are we offering customers to help them complete jobs? Number two, is what we're offering a pain reliever that cuts out risks, obstacles, and bad outcomes? And number three, better yet, is what we're offering a gain creator? Together, customers and products help us define our value. So let's get down to the nitty-gritty details of writing a value proposition, shall we? In order to figure out the jobs, pains, and gains of our customers, we have to find them and get nosy about their lives. But I mean, try to keep it professional. This is entrepreneurship, leave your Facebook stalking skills out of it. Some might call this research finding your target market, the people most likely to buy from you. There are lots of ways to connect with potential customers, but industry favorites include interviewing them one-on-one, holding focus groups, or conducting surveys, either in-person or through an online service like SurveyMonkey. Remember, the goal is to learn from potential customers to turn your idea into a top-notch solution to a problem, whether you're working on spill-proof takeout containers or more affordable childcare. So sleuth out the who, what, where, when, why, and how of your target market. Who do you think or know is experiencing the problem? How old are they? Do they have a family? Or do they speak different languages? Are they a cat? Please say they're a cat. I understand them. What are they doing when they experience the problem? Are they working at a desk job, crafting something, or exercising? Maybe they're hiding under a blanket away from the world and their problems until they crumble into dust. Where are they experiencing the problem? Are they at work or at home? On a plane? A train? An automobile? When are they experiencing the problem? Is there a time of day, week, or year? Is it a seasonal problem? Maybe it changes with the phase of the moon and the flow of the tides. I mean, we cannot help it when Mercury's in retrograde. Take it from a Leo. Why are they experiencing the problem? Why are others not experiencing the problem? And like, why me? Why is it always me? And finally, how are different people experiencing the problem differently? How are they learning to cope with the problem or develop their own solutions? I mean, ignoring the problem is an option, but it's not always the best way to cope, says my therapist. All these questions paint a picture of who we're dealing with and give us a peek at their jobs. And when we're dealing with value propositions, customer jobs can be functional, social, or emotional. Functional jobs are what we'd traditionally recognize as work that pays the bills. A big mistake when writing a value proposition is only focusing on the functional jobs of our customers. So customers feel social obligations to look good or support their community. And emotional jobs are all the work we put in to grow as humans. The ultimate goal of understanding customer jobs is to get in their heads. What they do illuminates what they value, or what they'd like to value. Entrepreneurs want to change the status quo. So if we know what customers value, we can figure out how to get them what they want in a new or better format. Remember the point of a value proposition. Why should people choose you over everyone else? Disruption is one strategy to give customers value, and it's a hot business vocab word. Instead of challenging existing markets and trying to make our ideas stand out in a field of others, why not create a new market, often called a blue ocean? So our idea is like a seed sprouting a whole new garden. Here, we're not talking about value that comes from lower prices or faster delivery. We're talking about letting customers achieve the same jobs in a totally new format. Like once upon a time, radio was the cream of the crop for media in everyone's home. Radio listeners had two needs, one, to be entertained, and two, to stay informed. And radio met those needs by broadcasting different programs, from music to dramatic theater to news. Then along came television, a new disruptive media format that entertained and informed people. Because TV achieved similar customer needs in a fresh way, TV entrepreneurs didn't have to compete within the world of radio. They built their own world, created new value, and maybe even found new customers who weren't interested in radio at all. Of course, we know jobs don't come without pains. We're all human. The struggle is real. So when we think about our customers, we need to consider what risks or annoyances are getting in their way. If we can address those pains, that means we'll create better business with more value. If a customer's job is applying to college, some pains could be the clunky admissions website from 2002, application fees and tuition costs, a lack of family support, or the tradeoff between working to earn money and shelling out money for another degree. And customers wouldn't do jobs at all without gains, which tells us what they need or want to experience before or after a job. Sticking with that college application example, the gains might be better career prospects, a higher salary after graduation, exposure to new thoughts and ideas, a fresh start, or new friends. Now that we've researched our potential customers, we've filled out half of our value proposition canvas. Or you can sort all that knowledge with one of those conspiracy investigation walls with pushpins and multiple colors of string and newspaper clippings. You do you. It's your value proposition. Using all this info, we can prune our big entrepreneurial idea to make sure that our products and services are truly alleviating pains, creating gains, and adding value to people's lives. Once we've done this, our value proposition will be flourishing. To see how, let's go to the Thought Bubble. Stitch Fix is a personal styling service that sends clothes and accessories to people. It has customers all across the U.S. and soon across the U.K. Those customers have many jobs to do, but an obvious one is shop for clothes. Let's think of Stitch Fix customers as busy, technology-savvy people ages 25 to 50 living in the U.S. of all genders and working across all fields. And they've been willing to consistently spend some money on fashion. They might be pained by lots of things, like no time as they try to juggle work and family, a limited budget, living far from clothing stores, or having no idea what their body type is. Pear? Apple? Pineapple? I don't know. After exploring their target market, Stitch Fix offers pain relievers like a mobile app for convenience, different packages for different budgets, doorstep delivery, an easy return system, and personally styled wardrobes for different body types. Now, these customers might shop for clothes because they want gains of looking good and feeling confident in and out of the workplace. So Stitch Fix wants to deliver that gain. But they also create new gains using technology like their surveys for measurements and preferences, algorithms, and personal stylists to help their customers feel good about the clothes they get and save time by not wandering around a mall. Combining all this information, Stitch Fix came up with the elegant value proposition, we save our clients time by doing the shopping. If we were to get a little more detailed for them, we might say, Stitch Fix leverages technology to save working clients time by using personalized measurements, preferences, and stylists to shop for clothes which are delivered straight to their door. Thanks, Thought Bubble! After all this thinking and research, our value proposition is done-zo. So when you're asked, what are you worth? Squish down the panic, because you've put in the work, and you can show them what you've got. So what are you worth? My audience values entertainment and authentic connection. So I use writing, acting, motion graphics, and music to tell stories that make people feel less alone and highlight the complexities of the human experience. Today we learned about value and how customer-driven thinking can help us show off what our business has to offer. By understanding customer jobs, pains, and gains, we can make sure our products and services alleviate pains or create gains. And then boom, we have a value proposition, a statement basically saying why we're better than everybody else. Next time, we'll target the competition. Well, not target them like in target practice, but we will talk about how to figure out who you're competing with in this entrepreneurship arena and what can be learned from observing them.

186c45d8-d9c6-449a-a089-cde7cb8779b1,"Hey there, I'm Jabril, and I am John Green-bot, and welcome to Crash Course Artificial Intelligence. Now, I want to make sure we're starting on the same page. Artificial intelligence is everywhere. It's helping banks make loan decisions, and helping doctors diagnose patients. It's on our cell phones, autocompleting text. It's the algorithm recommending videos for you to watch after this one. AI already has a pretty huge impact on all of our lives. So people, understandably, have some polarized feelings about it. Some of us imagine that AI will change the world in positive ways. It could end car accidents because we have self-driving cars. Or it could give the elderly great personalized care. Others worry that AI will lead to constant surveillance by Big Brother government, some say the automation will take all of our jobs, or the robots might try and kill us all. No, we're not worried about you, John Green-bot. But when we interact with AI that's currently available like Siri... Hey Siri, is AI going to kill us all? I don't understand, is AI going to kill us all? It's clear that those are still distant futures. Now, to understand where artificial intelligence might be headed, and our role in the AI revolution, we have to understand how we got to where we are today. INTRO If you know about artificial intelligence mostly from movies or books, AI probably seems like this vague label for any machine that can think like a human. Fiction writers like to imagine a more generalized AI, one that can answer any question you might have and do anything a human can do. But that's a pretty rigid way to think about AI, and it's not super realistic. Sorry John Green-bot, you can't do all that yet. A machine is said to have artificial intelligence if it can interpret data, potentially learn from the data, and use that knowledge to adapt and achieve specific goals. Now, the idea of learning from the data is kind of a new approach, but we'll get more into that in episode 4. So, let's say we load a new program into John Green-bot. This program looks at a bunch of photos of me, and some of not of me, and then learns from the data. Then we can show him a new photo, like this selfie of me here in the studio filming this Crash Course video, and we'll see if he can recognize if the photo is me. If he can correctly classify that new photo, we can say that John Green-bot has some artificial intelligence. Of course, that's a very specific input of photos, and a very specific task of classifying a photo that's either me or not me. With just that program, John Green-bot can't recognize or name anyone who isn't me. You. Are. Not. Jabril. He can't navigate to places, or hold a meaningful conversation. No, I just don't get it. Why would anyone choose a bagel when you have a perfectly good donut right here? You. Are. Jabril. Thanks, John Green-bot. He can't do most things that humans do, which is pretty standard for AI these days. But even with this much more limited definition of artificial intelligence, AI still plays a huge role in our everyday lives. There are some more obvious uses for AI, like Alexa or Roomba, which is kind of like the AI from science fiction, I guess. But there are also a ton of less obvious examples. When we buy something in a big store or online, we have one type of AI deciding which and how many items to stock. And as we scroll through Instagram, a different type of AI picks ads to show us. AI helps determine how expensive our car insurance is, or whether we get approved for a loan. And AI even affects big life decisions. Like when you submit your college or job application, AI might be screening it before a human even sees it. The way AI and automation are changing commerce and jobs is sort of like the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century. This change is global. Some people are excited about it, and others are afraid of it. But either way, we all have a responsibility to understand AI and figure out what role AI will play in our lives. The AI revolution itself isn't even that old. The term artificial intelligence didn't even exist a century ago. It was coined in 1956 by a computer scientist named John McCarthy. He used it to name the Dartmouth Research Project on Artificial Intelligence. Most people just call it the Dartmouth Conference for short. Now, this is way more than a weekend where you listen to a few talks and maybe go to a networking dinner. Back in the day, academics got together to think for a while. The conference lasted eight weeks and got a bunch of computer scientists, cognitive psychologists, and mathematicians to join forces. Many of the concepts that we'll talk about in Crash Course AI, like artificial neural networks, were dreamed up and developed during this conference and in the few years that followed. But because these excited academics were pretty optimistic about artificial intelligence, they may have oversold it a bit. For example, Marvin Minsky was a talented cognitive scientist who was a part of the Dartmouth Conference. But he had some ridiculously wrong predictions about technology, and specifically AI. In 1970, he claimed that in three to eight years, we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being. And sorry, Marvin, but we're not even close to that now. Scientists at the Dartmouth Conference seriously underestimated how much data and computing power an AI would need to solve complex real-world problems. See, artificial intelligence doesn't really know anything when it's created. Kind of like a human baby. Babies use their senses to perceive the world and their bodies to interact with it. And they learn from the consequences of their actions. My baby niece might put a strawberry in her mouth and decide that it's tasty. And then she might put Play-Doh in her mouth and decide that it's gross. Babies experience millions of these data-gathering events as they learn to speak, walk, think, and not eat Play-Doh. Now, most kinds of artificial intelligence don't have things like senses, a body, or a brain that can automatically judge a lot of different things like a human baby does. Modern AI systems are just programs and machines. So, we need to give an AI a lot of data. Plus, we have to label the data with whatever information the AI is trying to learn, like whether food tastes good to humans. And then, the AI needs a powerful enough computer to make sense of all the data. All of this just wasn't available in 1956. Back then, an AI could maybe tell the difference between a triangle and a circle, but it definitely couldn't recognize my face in the photo like John Green-bot did earlier. So, until about 2010 or so, the field was basically frozen in what's called the AI winter. Still, there were a lot of changes in the last half a century that led us to the AI revolution. As a friend once said, history reminds us that revolutions are not so much events as they are processes. The AI revolution didn't begin with a single event, idea, or invention. We got to where we are today because of lots of small decisions and two big developments in computing. The first development was a huge increase in computing power and how fast computers could process data. To see just how huge, let's go to the Thought Bubble. During the Dartmouth Conference in 1956, the most advanced computer was the IBM 7090. It filled a whole room, stored data on basically giant cassette tapes, and took instructions using paper punch cards. Every second, the IBM 7090 could do about 200,000 operations. But if you tried to do that, it would take you 55 and a half hours, assuming you did one operation per second and took no breaks. That's right, not even for snacks. At the time, this was enough computing power to help with the U.S. Air Force Ballistic Missile Warning System. But AI needs to do a lot more computations with a lot more data. The speed of a computer is linked to the number of transistors it has to do operations. Every two years or so since 1956, engineers have doubled the number of transistors that can fit in the same amount of space. So computers have gotten much faster. When the first iPhone was released in 2007, it could do about 400 million operations per second. But 10 years later, Apple says the iPhone X's processor can do about 600 billion operations per second. That's like having the computing power of over a thousand original iPhones in your pocket. For all the nerds out there, listen, you're right. It's not quite that simple. We're just talking about flops here. And a modern supercomputer, which does computational functions like the IBM 7090 did, can do over 30 quadrillion operations per second. To put it another way, a program that would have taken a modern supercomputer one second to compute would have taken the IBM 7090 4,753 years. Thanks, Thought Bubble. So computers started to have enough computing power to mimic certain brain functions with artificial intelligence in 2005. And that's when the AI winters started to show signs of thawing. But it doesn't really matter if you have a powerful computer, unless you also have a lot of data for it to munch on. The second development that kicked off the AI revolution is something that you're using right now, the internet and social media. In the past 20 years, our world has become much more interconnected. Whether you livestream from your phone or just use a credit card, we're all participating in the modern world. Every time we upload a photo, click a link, tweet a hashtag, tweet without a hashtag, like a video on YouTube, tag a friend on Facebook, argue on Reddit, post on TikTok, RIP Vine, support a Kickstarter campaign, buy snacks on Amazon, call Uber from a party, and basically anything that generates data. Even when we do something that seems like it's offline, like applying for a loan to buy a new car or using a password at the airport, those datasets end up in a bigger system. The AI revolution is happening now, because we have this wealth of data and the computing power to make sense of it. And I get it. The idea that we're generating a bunch of data, but don't always know how, why, or if it's being used by computer programs can be kind of overwhelming. But through Crash Course AI, we want to learn how artificial intelligence works, because it's impacting our lives in huge ways, and that impact will only continue to grow. With knowledge, we can make small decisions to help guide the AI revolution, instead of feeling like we're riding on a roller coaster we didn't even sign up for. We're creating the future of artificial intelligence together, every single day, which I think is pretty cool. Next time, we'll start to dive into technical ideas like supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, and we'll discuss what makes a machine learning algorithm good. See you then.

e2f57d38-f7d8-4677-beb7-83430add0ce2,"Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course Literature, and today we'll be doubling, bubbling, toiling, and troubling as we continue our discussion of Macbeth. Today we'll be looking more closely at the characters of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, as well as discussing the play's treatment of gender roles, and the question of whether life is just a tale told by an idiot. INTRO So one of the most remarkable things about Macbeth is that it presents us with a hero who is also a villain. Like, as we discussed last time, when we first meet Macbeth, he's just helped win a major battle for Scotland. The first time he's mentioned, a sergeant introduces him as Brave Macbeth, and being brave and winning battles were two of the major signs of great mandom at the time. Now, yes, this Macbeth is already a bit violent. He does slice an opponent down the middle and spike his head on the battlements. But he's definitely still the hero of the day, and Duncan, the king, rewards him. And at the beginning of the play, I think Shakespeare wants us to be on Macbeth's side, and we stay on his side when he has a lot of second thoughts about his wife's plan to kill the king. Basically, his wife has to talk him into it, and she does that by attacking his masculinity, but more on that later. I think, though, that our sympathies mostly stay with Macbeth even after the murder. We worry that someone is going to find him out, maybe the same someone who's knocking so relentlessly on the gate, and we hope he gets away with it, even though we know it's horrible. Like, one of the ways Shakespeare gets us to empathize with Macbeth is by showing just how conflicted he is about this whole king-killing thing. I mean, it literally sickens him. But then, once he becomes king, his paranoia kicks in, and so does his cruelty. He starts ordering more murders, maybe even some that he doesn't have to order, like that of Banquo. And now he's the one encouraging murders, not his wife. He's gone from being a hero at the start of the play to being very much the anti-hero, a journey that has since been undertaken by everyone from Walter White to Tony Soprano to Pablo Escobar to Don Draper to Jamie Lannister to that Hannibal Lecter guy in Westworld. I wonder if it's a coincidence that all those dudes are dudes. Probably not. But before we get there, let's examine how to understand Macbeth's choices in the Thought Bubble. Could we argue that Macbeth's encounter with the witches has made him evil? I mean, there's no suggestion that they've enchanted him, and they never tell him to kill Duncan or even suggest that killing Duncan is a possibility. They let Macbeth and his wife figure that part out for themselves, along with all the blood and the daggers. But the witches do light up his ambition with their prophecies. Now, maybe Macbeth has been a terrible guy from the get-go, a thane who just needed the excuse of the witches' prophecies to act on his worst impulses. As we saw, there are signs of his cruelty even from the beginning. Splitting open opponents from neck to belly is not the work of an especially meek and mild person. But then, if Macbeth is inherently evil in the manner of some Shakespeare villains, then why do his actions trouble him so much? Almost immediately, Macbeth loses the ability to pray and sleep, and he even seems to envy Duncan. After life's fitful fever, he sleeps well. Meanwhile, Macbeth is an insomniac. He also doesn't seem to enjoy being king, a job he was literally willing to kill for. And whether he actually sees Banquo's ghost in the banquet scene or just hallucinates him, neither suggests a man who is happy in his life choices. A sociopathic villain, like I'd argue Iago is in Othello, just wouldn't be haunted in that way. But for a guy who maybe isn't evil to begin with, he does keep getting a lot of people murdered. Or maybe, seeing that the murder of Duncan has already damned him for eternity, he figures there's no point repenting now. As he says to his wife, Basically, if you're already midway through fording the river of blood, shouldn't you just go ahead and cross over to the other side? Thanks, Thought Bubble. So that is actually a really interesting theological question. If you've done something that's so terrible that it can't be forgiven, that you are already damned for all eternity, what is the point of even trying to be good? That question was much explored in Shakespeare's time and is related to the question of predestination. Can we do things that are so bad that they're unforgivable, or is forgiveness always available to all humans? As usual when it comes to Shakespeare's theology, he asks the question without offering an answer, which in 17th century England was a good strategy. But however we understand Macbeth, by the midpoint of the play, probably around when he orders the murder of Banquo and his son, we've mostly stopped rooting for Macbeth and his wife to get away with their crimes. Instead, we're hoping they'll get their comeuppance, preferably before Macduff's wife and kids are brutally murdered in front of us. But alas, Shakespeare keeps the violence offstage until that scene and then allows it full reign, which should shake anyone who still feels sympathy for Macbeth. Even the witches now acknowledge his evil. The next time he approaches them, they say, Something wicked this way comes. And as for Nameless Lady Macbeth, Hollinshead, the author of the play's source material, describes her as She's the one spurring Macbeth on to murder when he's reluctant or frightened or listening to his conscience. In her opinion, at least early in the play, stabbing a king is no big deal. She even offers to go frame the guards by smearing them with Duncan's blood, saying, And it's interesting to note the opposite effect the murder has on each of them. It hardens Macbeth into a serial murderer, but it softens Lady Macbeth into a victim. Her mind becomes disturbed, she begins to sleepwalk, miming, washing her hands over and over, desperate for that little water that will clear her of the deed. But even endless water and washing can't get the spot of blood out, even after it's visibly gone. It's often been said that Lady Macbeth is the first character in English literature to have obsessive-compulsive disorder, and I have to say, as someone with OCD, that I can certainly see some similarities. Except for the record, I have never encouraged my spouse to kill the king of Scotland. Or anyone. To understand more about this dynamic, let's look at how the play treats masculinity and femininity. This tragedy has a particular interest in what it means to be a man, but we get our first taste of this by characters who don't really seem male or female, the witches. Banquo says to them, These are the Weird Sisters, which may be a corruption of the Wayward Sisters, and there's definitely a suggestion that characters who aren't identifiable as either male or female are destabilizing and upsetting. And this was certainly a period that oppressed gender fluidity, even though it's worth noting that theater was a place of gender complexity, since male actors played female roles, and Shakespeare's characters often play with traditional gender constructions. But we get another taste of how the play imagines masculinity when Lady Macbeth reads her husband's letter and starts worrying that he won't be man enough to get himself the crown. Knowing that he'll need her help, she calls on spirits to unsex her. Make thick my blood, stop up the access and passage to remorse, that no compunctions visiting of nature shall my fell purpose, nor keep peace between the effect and it. Come to my woman's breast and take my milk for gall. Okay, wow, so Lady Macbeth is saying, stop me from menstruating, stop me from lactating, basically take everything about me that is liquid and feminine and pliable and make me hard and cruel. When Macbeth tells her he's not going to kill the king, she tells him he's unmanly. When you durst do it, then you were a man, she says. And then it gets worse. She says that she's breastfed children, where those children have gone is the sort of problem that gives literary scholars fits, and loved those children, but that she would happily, quote, have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums and dashed the brains out, had I so sworn as you have done to this. Again, wow. And just a cool poetic meter note here, when they're having these kinds of arguments, especially the one about killing Duncan, many of Macbeth's lines have so-called feminine endings, which means an extra syllable in the line, and Lady Macbeth's don't. So far, the play seems to be suggesting that there's something cruel and almost unnatural about masculinity, about this idea of manning up. And maybe we can see this as another reason why Macbeth gets so murdery. Having committed to such a hard and unyielding version of masculinity, like the kind his wife offers, he doesn't really know how to soften again. But that is not the only vision of masculinity that the play provides. There's a scene between Malcolm and Macduff, where Malcolm tries to brag that he's really evil and greedy and lecherous, but then he takes it all back, suggesting that it's his innocence and even his virginity, his unmanliness, that will actually make him an honorable king. And in that same scene, Macduff learns that his wife and all of his children have been murdered, and nice virginal Malcolm tries to tell him Lady Macbeth-style to man up, dispute it like a man, Malcolm says. But here's the difference between Macduff and Macbeth. Instead of going along with this toxic vision of masculinity, Macduff finds another way. He says, Macduff, you'll recall, is not of woman born, so you could argue he's the manliest of anyone in the play. And his definition of manliness is different. It involves fighting, but it also involves feeling and loving and mourning. Of course, none of that stops him from decapitating Macbeth in the end, but Macbeth deserves it. And let's take a quick look at that ending. So before the final battle, Macbeth receives the news that his wife has died, and he recites a soliloquy, saying that To him, now, life means nothing. Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Those beautifully written, if somewhat nihilistic, lines have resonated through the last 400 years. Faulkner titled his most famous book after them. Here at the end, Macbeth doesn't seem anything like the Thane we met at the beginning of the play. He doesn't seem worried or brave or ambitious or bloodthirsty. He just seems tired. The dagger, the line of kings, Banquo's ghost, even his wife's death, none of it matters. And yet, he doesn't let that stop him from going on one last murderous rampage before his own death. His humanity just seems gone, and it's almost as though he'd like someone to stop him. But he can't bring himself to commit suicide, and he's worried that no one equals him in battle. But then, there is the surprise of Macduff, the C-section baby. But what I find fascinating is that even here at this revelation, Macbeth is still worrying about his manliness, saying, Accursed be that tongue that tells me so, for it hath cowed my better part of man. Grieving Macduff, meanwhile, is much more worried about cutting off Macbeth's head, which he does. Then, of course, being a Shakespearean tragedy, there must be a fond farewell, which comes from Malcolm, who talks about the dead butcher and his fiend-like queen. But none of those words, not dead, not butcher, not fiend-like, and not queen, describe the Macbeth and Lady Macbeth we meet early in the play. It's a short play that charts two extraordinary transformations of character. And at the end, we still don't know if Macbeth's fall was inevitable, even divinely ordained, or whether he brought it on himself through his choices. Macbeth, both the play and the man, is complicated, just like the world that shaped them. But one of the reasons Shakespeare's plays have hung around is because the best characters in them aren't one thing or another. They aren't only good or only evil. They aren't only ambitious or only meek, only weak or only strong. Macbeth endures because ambition and its cost endure, and because we are still asking that old question, Was I doomed to this, or did I choose it? Thanks for watching. We'll see you next week.

55eaf08b-9fff-4846-acca-62e9b2893c8b,"In 2018, I got to walk across the surface of a receding glacier in Iceland. From where I stood, I could see a patch of snow and ice off in the distance, the last remnants of another glacier that had since melted away. That ice-speckled area was all that remained of 800-year-old Okjökull, or Oak Glacier, which was officially declared dead in 2014 by Icelandic geologist Odur Sigurðsson. It once spanned an area as large as 38 square kilometers. In 2019, the loss of Okjökull was commemorated with a plaque on the site of the former glacier. It's the first monument dedicated to a glacier lost to human-induced global warming. Looking after our planet and all its dynamic ecosystems and landscapes, including glaciers, is everyone's job. We know rising temperatures are correlated with rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and the amount of carbon dioxide generated by our day-to-day actions can have an effect on the other side of the world. But while individual actions matter, who is emitting carbon dioxide is highly unequal. About half of total U.S. emissions in 2019 were direct emissions from corporations, coming from sources like power plants and oil and gas production facilities. So they also have responsibility to share the burden. Knowing who or what is emitting carbon dioxide is only part of understanding climate change. We also study who emissions affect and the geographical impacts of a warming planet. Climates are complex, so I don't have all the answers, but there's a lot we can learn. I'm Alizé Carrère, and this is Crash Course Geography. INTRO Even with a problem as complicated as climate change, we can start with a picture. Like this picture of Muir Glacier in Alaska from 2004. Pictures and maps can show us where landmasses, oceans, and geographical features are located, which is spatial information that we kinda take for granted. The Earth is dynamic, and we have to remember that both pictures and maps are really snapshots of a particular time. So if we compared this image to past ones of the same area, we'd see how it's changed and we could explore why change is happening here. A photo taken in 1941 from the exact same spot as the recent photo shows an entirely different landscape. The glacier was much bigger. After looking at lots of old and new photographs, current glaciological surveys, and the geologic record, we know glaciers around the world in places like Alaska, the Swiss Alps, and Mount Kilimanjaro have shrunk dramatically. Muir Glacier is just one example. To get deeper into the why, we know that ice and snow melt faster as air temperatures get warmer. But glaciers also depend on how much precipitation they get each year. If less snow accumulates, glaciers lose more ice on their bottom edge than they can replace at the top. That precipitation comes from the hydrosphere, and its regional patterns can depend on temperature and wind patterns over distant oceans. So mountain landscapes have changed as climate patterns have changed. Which ties back to the global energy budget and insulation and… the beginning of the Earth. It's a complicated problem. The terms climate change and global warming are often used interchangeably. But even though these phenomena are closely related, there is a difference between them. Climate change is the change in average weather patterns in a region over a long period of time. These changes can be natural or anthropogenic, meaning human-induced. And when I say long, I mean each climate period can last for several decades or longer. For example, there was a little ice age that happened from 1300 to 1850 CE. Mountain glaciers expanded worldwide, and mean annual temperatures dropped by 0.6 degrees Celsius in the northern hemisphere. That's a 550-year climate pattern, which then changed to a different one. On the other hand, global warming is the increase in the average surface temperature of our planet. In our current period of global warming, there's been a well-documented rise of average temperatures around the globe since the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s and 1800s. So when scientists or leaders talk about global warming, they're almost exclusively referring to this recent warming, which comes from human activities that increase greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. They trap solar energy so more heat is held in the atmosphere. That additional energy is changing not only the average temperature, but also climate processes within the atmosphere and oceans. These include more extreme storms, heat waves, droughts, changing regional temperature and precipitation patterns that cause vegetation zones to shift and glaciers to melt, which results in sea level rise and changing coastlines. Essentially, when the planet gets warmer, climates change. We know the Earth has had many different climates thanks to paleoclimatologists, who study past climates through proxy data, or data that provides clues about the past. Comparing multiple proxies gives us a more complete picture of what happened and helps us anticipate the changes we need to prepare for. For example, they use tree rings that show dry and wet years, fossilized bugs that tell us about moisture and temperature levels of bygone ecosystems, or deep-sea sedimentary records that reveal the ocean's past. Like, the deep-sea sedimentary record shows that the Earth overall had one of two extreme climates, and glaciers advanced and retreated across the Earth at least 28 times during the past 2.6 million years. We can see that when glaciers advance and the climate is colder, glaciation occurs and sea levels drop. And when the climate is warmer, glaciers retreat and sea levels rise, ushering in an interglacial period. Which is what we're in right now. One of the most useful kinds of proxy data for atmospheric conditions and how climates changed year to year are ice core data. From ice, we can extract the chemical composition of past atmospheres. Using special drills, paleoclimatologists have extracted long tubes of ice from ice sheets and alpine glaciers all over the world and estimated climates going back at least 400,000 years. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. On the top is fresh snow that fell this year, and the year before, and the year before that. Underneath is the snow that fell when Marco Polo traveled the Silk Road, and beneath that when the Buddha gained enlightenment. And the deepest layers were laid down long before recorded history. The very bottom of ice sheets in places like Greenland and Antarctica have snow that fell before the beginning of the last ice age, 115,000 years ago or more. Just like snow on a sidewalk can get compressed by boots into sheets of slippery ice, the snow on ice sheets is compacted into huge solid masses. And buried in each layer of ice is evidence of past atmospheric conditions. Tiny air bubbles, which act like time capsules. Once an ice core is moved from the field to the lab, scientists use isotope dating to tell whether the carbon dioxide in those frozen bubbles was released from burning materials like wood or coal in the lithosphere, or if it was airborne during a nuclear explosion, or if it was part of the natural cycling of carbon. Paleoclimatologists have collected polar ice core samples and analyzed historical air bubbles from Greenland and Antarctica, tropical glaciers in the mountains of the Andes and Kenya, and mid-latitude glaciers in the Alps and Himalayas. When all these data are lined up, scientists can compare them with each other and see atmospheric trends, which in turn shows climate change over thousands of years. Analysis shows that it can take just a few decades to change from colder to warmer climate patterns. That might not sound fast, but when you're a 4.5 billion year old planet like the Earth, that's nothing. Thanks, Thought Bubble! By analyzing proxy data like bubbles in ice cores, we know the Earth's climate has changed significantly many times. As geographers, let's go deeper into why these drastic changes happen. Based on that proxy data, paleoclimatologists hypothesize that climates change because of any combination of several driving forces. First, past climates could have changed because of orbital causes, like changes in the shape of the Earth's orbit, its tilt on its axis, and the time of year when the Sun is closest to the Earth. Like calculations by the mathematician Milutin Milankovitch show that lots of glacial cycles occur every million years. Second, volcanic activity can release enormous amounts of volcanic dust into the stratosphere. Strong winds spread that dust around the world, darken the skies, and reduce the amount of insulation that can reach the surface, which lowers temperatures. This is related to the albedo effect, or the amount of sunlight a surface reflects back into space. Volcanic dust and even the color of surfaces change Earth's albedo. White surfaces, like ice, reflect the Sun's energy, creating a cooling effect. So when there's less ice, the opposite happens. Darker surfaces absorb sunlight and warm the surface of the Earth. Similarly, when something big like an asteroid strikes, it can cause an impact winter. Like volcanic activity, a big impact throws dust and debris into the air, blocking out insulation and lowering temperatures. Such an impact may have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Another reason that climates change is when continents and oceans get rearranged. Like when the Isthmus of Panama formed, it broke the connection between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, which redirected ocean circulation and created the Gulf Stream. This changed how moisture and ocean currents moved around the globe, which as we know contributes to climate patterns. And finally, climates change when greenhouse gases in the atmosphere change. We know from ice core data that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere decreased when glaciers formed during ice ages, and increased during interglacial periods. However, what's happening now is unlike anything in the past. We're in an interglacial period now, and glaciers are melting faster than ever before in the geologic record. Average annual global temperatures have risen between 0.3°C and 0.6°C, and sea level has risen between 10 and 25 cm during the past 100 years. And in 2016, global atmospheric carbon dioxide levels passed the 400 parts per million mark, which is higher than at any time in the past million years. More carbon dioxide increases the amount of heat trapped in the lower atmosphere, enhancing the natural greenhouse effect that makes life possible. So our climates are entering new patterns. If this upward trend in global temperatures was caused by natural processes alone, geographers would consider it natural climate change. But like I said, what's happening now is unlike anything we've ever seen on Earth. So scientists have used multiple lines of evidence like tree ring and ice core data, glacial retreat and sea level rise, isotope dating, changes in atmosphere, and changes in weather phenomena to study the climate. And they've concluded that there is a greater than 95% probability that human activities, like burning fossil fuels, industrialization, modern agriculture, and deforestation, have caused most of the Earth's warming since the mid-20th century. We are experiencing anthropogenic global warming. But not all areas will be affected equally by global warming and modern climate change. While materially rich countries are the main producers of greenhouse gas emissions, materially poorer countries will bear most of the impacts, like becoming climate refugees, people being forced to flee their homes for safer places. Thousands of low-lying islands and coastal cities face a threat of rising sea levels by the end of the 21st century, when sea levels are predicted to have risen 26 to 77 centimeters. That's pretty significant considering over half of the world's people live within 100 kilometers of a coastline. For example, located halfway between Australia and Hawaii, Kiribati has 33 atolls that sit less than 2 meters above sea level and average only a few hundred meters wide. The government of Kiribati is planning a two-phase Migration with Dignity and has purchased several thousand acres of land in Fiji as a potential resettlement location for its 102,000 residents. But Migration with Dignity isn't an option for all countries and communities. For some places, adaptation is the only option, like building seawalls or raising streets and homes. And for some, that will mean moving to higher elevations after the flooding without government support for the process. Flooding from sea level rise is just one of many changes that we can anticipate. Other places, for example, will experience drier conditions with the potential for droughts, heat waves, and wildfires. The current ways the Earth's climate is changing because of global warming will affect all of us as individuals, so it's our collective responsibility to pay attention and take action. Here's the thing about human-induced climate change. Knowing that we humans are the main cause means it's also in our power to try and stop it. We still have a small window of time to work together and aggressively reduce our emissions to save communities around the world from disaster. To do that, our individual choices can make a difference, but we also have to hold corporations and governments responsible for the policies and large-scale emissions that affect our atmosphere and climate. This will ensure safer, healthier, and more biodiverse futures for the next generation who inherit our planet. I know the problem of global warming may sound overwhelming. You're not alone. But from decades of science, we know what the problem is and what the solutions are. It's now just about finding ways to successfully integrate them into society. In future episodes, we'll continue to examine how geography can help us work on the problems that pop up where climate change intersects with society. This has been the focus of my research for the last several years, and even though it's an urgent area of work, it's also incredibly motivating and exciting to be a part of finding the solutions. Many maps and borders represent modern geopolitical divisions that have often been decided without the consultation, permission, or recognition of the land's original inhabitants. Many geographical place names also don't reflect the Indigenous or Aboriginal people's languages. So we at Crash Course want to acknowledge these people's traditional and ongoing relationship with that land and all the physical and human geographical elements of it. We encourage you to learn more about the history of the place you call home through resources like NativeLand.ca and by engaging with your local Indigenous and Aboriginal nations through the websites and resources they provide.

ad287767-62f6-4b2c-ac8e-3420291d366c,"Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course Literature, and today we're letting Virginia Wolfe take us to the lighthouse. Well, assuming the weather holds and we don't get lost in our endless, spiraling contemplation of the ephemerality of all human life. We're going to explore To the Lighthouse as a modernist novel, examine its form and style, and discuss its philosophy and also its thrilling plot. So get that rowboat ready. INTRO So Virginia Stephen was born in 1882 to Julia Jackson Duckworth, a member of a publishing family, and Leslie Stephen, a literary critic and the founder of the Dictionary of National Biography. They were English, if you can't tell from their names and the idea of a dictionary of national biography. Both her parents had been married before. She had three full siblings and four half-siblings, and her most treasured childhood memories were of holidays spent in Cornwall, conveniently near a lighthouse. In 1904, she and her sister Vanessa moved into a house in Bloomsbury, London, and became the center of a social circle of artists and writers and thinkers known as the Bloomsbury Group. Stephen began to write for the Times Literary Supplement, and in 1912 she married the political theorist Leonard Wolfe. In 1915, Virginia Wolfe published her first novel. She also struggled with mental illness throughout most of her life, even as she became an acclaimed writer of fiction and non-fiction, and during the Second World War, she loaded her pockets with stones and walked into a river, drowning herself. Okay, so that's a bit about the author. Before we explore the form and themes of To the Lighthouse, let's review the plot. The Ramsey family and a few friends spend a day at their vacation home. They talk about going to the lighthouse, but don't. Ten years pass, and then they do go to the lighthouse, and then the book is over. No real need to go to the Thought Bubble for that plot. But even though not much happens, a lot is happening in To the Lighthouse. So this is a modernist novel. Broadly speaking, modernism was a philosophical and cultural movement that got going in the late 19th century and reached its apex just after World War I. Modernism encouraged the questioning and dismantling of institutions and concepts that were long thought to be stable—government, the church, social hierarchies—but also artistic concepts like the chromatic music scale or figurative painting. With 40 million people dead on the World War I battlefield, it was hard to go back to the same old pictures and tunes. But also, changes in technology were reshaping the role that different forms of art could play in human life. I mean, who needs to read a book to experience a thrilling, moving picture that takes place inside your mind when you can just, like, watch an actual movie? So modernism sought to break with the past and search for new forms, both because art needed to and because the old forms felt an insufficient response to a world that, from machine guns to electricity, seemed very new. Modernism was anti-enlightenment in its rejection of certainties, but it was also anti-romantic in that there was no great belief in nature or spirit to explain everything. Instead, modernism embraced subjectivity and fragmentation. It suggested that there's not one right way to see or know things, but a multiplicity of legitimate narratives. You can literally see this fragmentation in modern art, I mean, look at Guernica. And like Guernica, the great works of modernist literature suggest that if you put a lot of fragments and perspectives together, you can begin to better understand the complex truths of the world. And with its shifting points of view and refusal to privilege any one character, To the Lighthouse really exemplifies and also helped to define the modernist novel. Here's another way of thinking about it. If To the Lighthouse were a pre-modern novel, one that had stable narration and none of this radical subjectivity, it would be, you know, like, even shorter than it is because nothing happens. And the one section where stuff does happen, like a bunch of characters get killed off, it's tucked away in brackets and written from the perspective of a house, which is quite modernist and I think quite interesting. But before we get to that, let's take a look at three of the human characters in this story with our two eyes. Take it away, Thought Bubble. First, we have Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey, the parents of eight children, Andrew, Prue, Jasper, Roger, Nancy, Rose, Cam, and James. I hope you got that because there will be a quiz later. Mrs. Ramsey has kind of a mother-goddess aura, even when she's worrying about how much it will cost to fix the greenhouse and whether her guests will like the beef stew. Actually, liking the beef stew is one of the real nail biters in this novel. Mrs. Ramsey is loving and sympathetic and an acute observer of her family and guests. Sometimes her work as a wife and mother and hostess exhausts her, but she does it anyway because that's what women are supposed to do. Mrs. Ramsey embraces conventional gender roles, believing that marriage and childbirth are the only really appropriate path for a woman to take. Mr. Ramsey, her husband, is a professor of metaphysical philosophy, and he can be tyrannical in his moods, and unlike his wife, he doesn't typically notice the wants and needs of the people around him. But he needs his wife's love desperately, even more than she needs his. He's anxious about his achievements as a philosopher and worried that his work won't last. This is Lily Briscoe, a friend of the family who lives with her widowed father. Mrs. Ramsey keeps trying to set her up with this guy William Banks, but Lily doesn't much want to get married. She wants to paint, and along with the journey to the lighthouse, it's her efforts to finish a painting of Mrs. Ramsey and James that draws the novel together. Lily isn't always certain about her choices, personal and artistic, but she comes to realize that making art, even if no one ever sees or likes or buys her artwork, is reward enough. Thanks, Thought Bubble. So Virginia Woolf described the form of this novel as two blocks joined by a corridor. The blocks are, of course, the first and last sections, the window and the lighthouse, and the corridor is the middle section, time passes, which we'll get to in a minute. The story is written in the third person, but it takes on the tone and thinking of the character that it's focusing on, which is constantly shifting. Spoiler alert, you will see more of that in our Jane Austen episodes in a couple weeks. Also see William Faulkner. But in the middle section, this style of narration, which is often known as free, indirect discourse, is at its most radical because the character driving the narrative isn't a Ramsey or a guest, it's the vacation house. The house has been left empty during and after the First World War, and the war is described as a terrible storm surrounding the house. The nights now are full of wind and destruction. The trees plunge and bend, and their leaves fly helter-skelter until the lawn is plastered with them, and they lie packed in gutters and choke rainpipes and scatter damp paths. People do appear in this section, but only briefly, and like I mentioned, their triumphs and deaths are discussed only in brackets, probably because what happens to individual humans doesn't really matter to a house. To the Lighthouse can also be described as a stream-of-consciousness novel because it records the flow from one thought to the next, along with the emotions that go with those thoughts. There are sometimes really intense emotions, even in response to very minor plot points, like when six-year-old James feels a murderous hatred for his father just because his dad thinks that it will probably rain the next day. The critic Eric Auerbach wrote that the novel captures nothing less than the wealth of reality and depth of life in every moment to which we surrender ourselves without prejudice. This combination of stream-of-consciousness and free, indirect discourse is what gives the novel its sense of fracture and fragment. When you read it, the switch from head-to-head and thought-to-thought can feel sort of destabilizing. But it also makes the few moments of real communion among the characters that much more marvelous. Like when they all come together at dinner and, wonder of wonders, they all like the beef stew. Also, the novel argues that this constantly shifting perspective is the only way to really understand the characters and their world comprehensively. In a lily passage about Mrs. Ramsey, we read, The novel also explores time and what it does to memory and houses and life, what is ephemeral and what is eternal, what we lose to time and the ways that we can, or something of us can, endure. A lot is lost to time in the story, but there are a few moments in which time seems to be suspended. The main one is at that beef stew dinner party when Mrs. Ramsey finally achieves a sense of peace. She feels There is a coherence in things, a stability, something she meant is immune from change and shines out, she glanced at the window with its ripple of reflected lights, in the face of the flowing, the fleeting, the spectral, like a ruby. Of such moments, she thought, the thing is made that endures. Mrs. Ramsey's genius is in bringing and holding people together so that for a few moments they feel that they are part of something greater than themselves. In that instant they can surrender their loneliness and their sorrow to sense an intimacy and a community that feels eternal. Mrs. Ramsey also makes a stand against the ephemeral by having so many children. Even after her death, her children remain, well, most of them anyway, which is a kind of immortality. Oh, it's time for the open letter? An open letter to immortality. But first, let's see what's in the secret compartment today. Ah, look, it's my bobble head. I'm going to live forever as a bobble head, unless people mistake this for ugly Justin Timberlake. Dear Immortality, Is there a noun in English that is more overrated? Look, I want to live for a very, very long time, but nobody wants to live forever. Have you ever read the literary classic Tuck Everlasting? Doesn't work out great. Being a vampire? Kind of a bummer. So I think the whole problem with immortality is that there is a huge difference between an extremely large number and an infinite number. An extremely large number, at least you know it will someday end. With an infinite number, what, are you going to somehow survive the heat death of the universe? That sounds like a terrible life. Oh yeah, I'm still here, many billions of years later. I don't have a lot of friends. I don't just mean that, like, I don't have any, like, human friends. I mean that there is, like, nothing left in the universe. So may you live a long, fascinating, and fulfilling life, and may it not last forever. Best wishes, John Green. Right, so the novel suggests there is one other path to immortality, which is through making art. Lily is haunted by the words of another party guest who says, women can't write, women can't paint, and she worries that her painting will probably just be rolled up under a sofa somewhere. But first off, she proves the critic wrong just by painting. And also, the painting itself, even if it isn't very good, even if it's just a purple triangle and a line in the middle, endures. It brings the novel full circle. And because it is a portrait, a very abstract one, but still a portrait, it's also capable of bringing Mrs. Ramsey back after she is gone, if only on canvas. Whether it's Mrs. Ramsey's party, or Lily's painting, or having a child, they all make of the moment something eternal. We've all known the feeling, or at least I hope you have, of being in a moment that felt infinite, whether you got there by art or by accident. And that's also what a novel does. The novel lasts. It says, in the words of Mrs. Ramsey, life stands still here. And to that end, I want to leave you with one more passage from the novel, a passage that argues that maybe we're never going to create a great work of art or even host the perfect dinner party, but that we can all look for moments when we feel touched by the eternal and part of something greater than ourselves. Here's Lily Briscoe. The great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead, there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark. In short, go play with matches. Metaphorical ones. Thank you for watching. I'll see you next time.

7e104a18-7406-4b54-a3e1-8e0a1bea2cab,"Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course Literature, and I have some bad news. Disease is devastating the planet. Soon, the global food supply will be compromised, clean water will become scarce, violence will grow epidemic, dangerous new street drugs will circulate, the income gap will increase, corporate slavery will return, and a strongman president will be more interested in issuing tough guy slogans than actually improving the lives of the people. Of course, none of that's happened yet. What's that? Oh, Stan informs me that some of it has happened. But the only place it's all happening so far is in Parable of the Sower, Octavia Butler's 1993 science fiction novel. It's just made up, thankfully. But geez, I have never read a dystopia that feels more possible or more terrifying. And yet, it's also one of my favorite books and a genuinely hopeful one, the kind of hard-won, uneasy hope that actually means something. INTRO Let's start with a brief introduction to the author, Octavia Butler. She was an African-American science fiction writer who won the Hugo and Nebula awards and a MacArthur Genius Grant. She died in 2006 at the age of 58. Growing up as a shy, only child in Pasadena, California, Butler spent a lot of time reading at her local library and telling herself her own stories. And then when she was nine, she saw a movie and thought, I could write a better story than that. So she did. Her aunt told her that an African-American girl couldn't be a writer, but she kept going. And as a young adult, she would get up at two in the morning so that she'd have time to write before working jobs like dishwasher and potato chip inspector. It wasn't until her early thirties that she was able to support herself entirely as a writer. Her works deal with race and class and power. And most of her books also include fantastical elements like time travel and alien life forms and telekinesis. She described herself as a pessimist if I'm not careful, a feminist, a black, a former Baptist, an oil and water combination of ambition, laziness, insecurity, certainty, and drive. Parable of the Sower is a coming of age story, one of the best of the past several decades. It's also a story about being black in America and a feminist story and a theological story and a dystopian story. And in some ways, maybe a bit of a utopian story. It takes its name from a Bible parable in which Jesus describes someone who goes out to distribute seed. Some of the seed falls on the path and is eaten up by birds. Some falls in a rocky place and can't grow. Some falls near thorns, so that's no good, but some of it falls on fertile ground and grows beautifully. So before we talk about genre and theme, let's look briefly at the story of Parable of the Sower in the Thought Bubble. When the book begins, Laura Oya Olamina is a 15-year-old girl growing up in a small community outside of Los Angeles in 2024. She lives with her father, a professor and Baptist minister, her stepmother, and her four half-brothers. Climate change and disease outbreaks have increased social disorder so much that Lauren's community has built a wall around it, and when people leave the community, they leave armed. Both Lauren and her father have become more and more worried about how long the community can survive, and they prepare stashes of money and supplies so they can run away if they have to. And Lauren also has other secrets. Because of drugs that her mother abused during pregnancy, Lauren has hyper-empathy. She feels what other people feel, which makes it hard for her to hurt anyone. Also, Lauren has begun to develop her own belief system, one that is different from her father's. It locates God in chaos and change and uncertainty. Throughout the book, we read pieces of a new kind of scripture. All that you touch, you change. All that you change, changes you. The only lasting truth is change. Lauren comes to call this religion Earthseed and believes that its purpose is to prepare humankind to take root among the stars. Eventually, her walled community is overrun, and unlike most of her family and friends, she manages to escape, and then Lauren meets up with other survivors. For a time, she disguises herself as a man and eventually begins walking north with a growing community, the first members of the Earthseed movement. Thanks, Thought Bubble. So there's a lot of death in this book, and like The Handmaid's Tale, the narrative voice is so strong that it all feels terrifyingly real. And yet, it is science fiction. It's set in the future, albeit barely, and there's speculation from 1993 about how climate change and wealth inequality and walls will shape the world of the future. Part of what makes Parable of the Sower and its sequel, Parable of the Talents, so powerful is how prophetic they seem. Another term for this kind of science fiction, which is set on Earth and uses contemporary technology, is mundane science fiction. Although, for the record, this is one of the least mundane books you'll ever read. In 1998, Butler told an audience that she liked to think of science fiction in terms of categories established by the writer Robert A. Heinlein, the what-if category, the if-only category, and the if-this-goes-on category. She described Parable of the Sower as definitely an if-this-goes-on story, and if it's true, if it's anywhere near true, we're all in trouble. Oh, it's time for the open letter? An open letter to my future self, but first let's see what's in the secret compartment today. Oh look, it's the Sky Express rocket ship that I'm going to use to travel around the solar system in the future. Dear future me, Parable of the Sower is set in 2024. It's currently 2017. You're watching this in 2024. How are we doing? Was Octavia Butler right that we were all in trouble? Because I'm concerned. So it's seven years in the future. How are things going? I think you guys recently had an election. Hopefully, did climate change turn out to be a hoax? Are we still doing crash course? Did the Looking for Alaska movie ever get made? Does Diet Dr. Pepper turn out to be bad for me? Has Liverpool won the Champions League? I have so many questions, but mostly, I just hope you're around to answer them. Best wishes, current John. So Parable of the Sower is obviously an exploration of if-this-goes-on, but it's also lots of other things. I want to look at two of the book's other genres, the book as a bildungsroman and also as a sacred text. So you might remember that bildungsroman is a long and fun to say German word that means novel of education, a story in which a young person grows up and becomes more or less independent. At the beginning of the book, Lauren is a teenage girl who does what her family expects of her. She agrees to be baptized in a religion she doesn't believe because her father wants her to. She helps out in the school that her stepmother runs, teaching the set curriculum. But as the book goes on, she starts thinking for herself more and more. She establishes her own belief system and begins to study how to survive in case her community breaks down. After talking things over with her father, she also starts conveying some of that information to the children at the school, even though survival skills are definitely not in the curriculum. And then when her neighborhood is overrun, Lauren learns her capacity for leadership. She protects others in her group, even though her hyper-empathy makes violent action nearly impossible. And she keeps them going until they find a safe place in Northern California. And we should mention here that Lauren's suffering and her escape, as well as her journey north, have led some critics to draw comparisons between Lauren's story and narratives of escape from slavery. And Lauren is an escapee and a leader, but she's also something else. In an interview, Butler explained that she wanted to tell the story of someone who, quote, sometime after her death, after people have had time to forget how human she was, might easily be considered a god. Now Lauren is human, but she does have this god-like capacity for empathy, and Parable of the Sower is in many ways a sacred text. It's structured as a series of journal entries, but it also features these passages from what Lauren calls the Book of the Living, a devotional text that people in the future might read and interpret. And we learn a lot about the belief system of Earthseed in these beautiful little passages from the Book of the Living. Earthseed is focused on the inevitability of change. Several times, in fact, it says that God is change. Lauren says that she's based these beliefs on everything I could read, hear, see, all the history I could learn. And Butler seems to draw on elements of Buddhism, Taoism, matriarchal religions, even a little bit of the Yoruba religion. It's probably not coincidental that Lauren's middle name, Oya, is the name of the goddess of the Niger River. But Lauren doesn't really believe in goddesses. As she says, Earthseed deals with ongoing reality, not supernatural authority figures. And as a person, she isn't perfect or puritanical. She gets angry. She steals when she has to. She has sex when she wants to. I mean to survive, she says. She also isn't always certain about the moral choices she's making, some of which are influenced by her hyper-empathy, which she calls a biological conscience. But that's all part of what makes this portrait of a prophet so fascinating. Butler shows us how her actions and her beliefs might influence future generations. According to the verses Lauren writes, Earthseed understands that God is power, infinite, irresistible, inexorable. And yet God is pliable, trickster, teacher, chaos, clay. God exists to be shaped. God is change. Change is the one inevitability in Parable of the Sower. It's the only constant in Lauren's trauma-filled life. In an essay on the book, the professor Philip H. Jost wrote that those who practice Earthseed must learn to respond positively to change. He writes, God is change is an invitation to respond to fear with creativity, productivity, and compassion. Practitioners must fully acknowledge and accept suffering and struggle as an inevitable companion to love and happiness. And I want to pause here and acknowledge that for a lot of its hardcore fans, Parable of the Sower is a sacred text. Another way to look at Parable of the Sower is as a dystopian novel exploring a world gone very, very wrong. And if we read the novel this way, Lauren and her community's journey toward a safer place can make the end of the book seem a little utopian, or at least as utopian as a book can be where political instability and environmental degradation mean that almost everyone dies horribly. I'd argue, though, that Butler takes care not to make the Earthseed community or its leader seem ideal. She once said, Personally, I find utopias ridiculous. We're not going to have a perfect human society until we get a few perfect humans, and that seems unlikely. For Lauren and for Butler, the past with legal racism and misogyny wasn't ideal. And what's fascinating to me about Parable of the Sower is Lauren's struggle to imagine a better world that is not based on past models, that isn't trying to go back in time or return to some imaginary golden age. The hope is less that Lauren's followers will create a utopia on Earth or elsewhere, and more that they will learn new and better forms of relating to each other and to the world around them, and that they will find something to unite them. Instead of a search for a paradise where nothing ever changes, they have to learn to embrace change and use that change to move forward and seek life among the stars. Whereas so many utopian and dystopian novels seem to argue for dismantling technology, Lauren sees this interstellar travel as a goal that can unite humanity. And as we come to the end of our miniseries on dystopias, although I suppose you could argue that Macbeth is fairly critical of traditional power structures, I think it's worth pausing to consider the if-this-goes-on-ness of Parable of the Sower. What forces or goals can unite and pacify us? We know how humans of the past have responded to resource pressures and deprivations. Is there a way that we can somehow avoid their mistakes when responding to the pressures and deprivations of a changing climate? And can we reconcile ourselves to change and live with it as the Book of the Living calls us to do? Parable of the Sower is so page-turningly compulsively readable that it's easy to miss the moments where Lauren and Butler speak directly to us and to our times. So I want to leave you with a quote from one such moment in the novel.

ec8b3b4a-3e77-4755-94d7-3562fc89dbde,"Whether it's the classic lightbulb above our heads or a eureka moment, we imagine ideas bursting out of creative people's brains like we all live in some cartoon universe and a lucky few of us get struck with inspiration. Maybe you're wondering whether entrepreneurship is for you, because you don't think you've had any great ideas, but just wait, because we can all get them. Or maybe you have an idea and you're not sure what to do next. How do you feed, water, and nurture this tiny seed so it grows into a whole business? Don't worry, we've got you. I'm Anna Akana and this is Crash Course Business Entrepreneurship. INTRO Entrepreneurs aren't a special group of people gifted with all the good ideas. They believe in themselves and the value of their idea enough to take a financial risk to make it a reality. Looking back at the people we now think of as great entrepreneurs, these people were just looking to make life easier or better in some way, from inventing the wheel to dreaming up the dishwasher. But what exactly sparked their imagination? What was their apple falling from a tree? Innovative ideas can be traced to three main sources, our passions, our complaints, and our egos. Let's start with the exciting one, our passions. If you weren't working at your current job or going to school, what would you do? Many ideas come from us being excited about something and wanting to share it with the world. It could be grandma's hot sauce recipe, video game walkthroughs, or upcycled yard sale furniture. Sometimes you start doing something as a hobby, like art, but then you might get commission requests from people you don't even know. So if you take a risk, that hobby could become a full-time job. Next, there are complaints. There must be something that bugs you, whether it's tangled headphones or a lack of movies directed by women. Dropbox was founded because someone was annoyed they kept forgetting their thumb drive. Under Armour was founded because someone got so tired of their shirt getting so sweaty they had to change it multiple times during one workout. So if you've ever found yourself thinking, wow, I really wish someone would do something about that, guess what? You can do something about it. And of course, there are the I-can-do-it-better ideas. Everyone has them. Our egos are a great place to find innovation and motivation. Maybe you visit the same coffee shop every morning, and after the thousandth cup of hot sludge you are so done. You could make a much better cup of coffee, and the cups would be compostable, and the tip jar would have a witty joke, and you would have fresh scones. Let that outrage fuel you. Think of something that needs freshening up. Uber and Lyft looked at the taxi industry and saw something outdated and clunky, so they made sleek apps with automated payments and directions. Now, obviously, there can be an overlap between these three motivations. You might be able to make a better cup of coffee than the big chain in town. That's ego. But that's only because you're into coffee and experiment with techniques and blends at home. That's passion. And maybe that hobby started because there weren't any coffee shops in your neighborhood. That's a complaint. Whether or not you have an idea notebook filled to the brim, you do have experiences, opinions, and a whole complicated life. And these are the building blocks of entrepreneurial innovation. So the first step is acknowledging you have an idea. Step two is understanding the problem at the root of your idea. Think of your idea as the beginning. You may have your own experience of a certain problem, but by understanding what others think, your idea can grow and affect more people. So when you're chatting about that big chain coffee shop with your friends, listen to what they say. Have they been there? What do they like? What do they hate? Do they complain, that place is a health hazard, or their service sucks, or they say, I never go there because I only drink tea. So use that quick insight to make your idea better. Maybe your coffee shop will focus on excellent staff training to ensure high-quality coffee, cleanliness, and customer service. And you'll offer lots of tea alongside those artisanal lattes. Even after you understand the problem, there's more talking to do. Let's look at my latest big idea. It's great, right? But now that I've told you, I'm going to have to kill you. When we have exciting new ideas, our first instinct is to squirrel them away so no one can steal them. But that's bad. When we keep things to ourselves, we end up thinking that shoe umbrellas are the next big thing. We have to share our ideas with the people who are actually going to use the product or service. Otherwise, our solutions inherit our blind spots and biases. They might not actually solve the problem, or they might only be useful for a few people. Let's explore this in a Thought Bubble. My friend Mary Cherry is deeply passionate about cream puffs. She also happens to be allergic to gluten. Mary was complaining that there were no cream puff bakeries in her whole city, so she launched a gluten-free pastry shop called Dream Puffs on her block. Now, Mary was so enthusiastic about bringing her dream to life that she didn't talk to potential customers, or even her friend and fellow cream puff connoisseur, Paul, before launching. She put in lots of time and money to set up her shop, complete with color-coordinated mixers, a chic logo, and a few flavors of gluten-free cream puff recipes. During the grand opening, Dream Puffs gets some buzz. But as the first week goes on, many potential customers don't actually buy her gluten-free cream puffs. Most of the people who show up have more than one allergy. Mary's cream puffs are gluten-free, but all of her luscious fillings have cream. She didn't even think about using dairy-free options for people with dairy allergies or lactose intolerance. And her non-basic flavors involve nuts like pistachios and almonds, but a lot of her potential customers have nut allergies. These are pretty huge setbacks, so now Mary has to spend more time and more money to develop new recipes and make sure that the quality and her star baker reputation is maintained. Then she has to retrain her staff. If Mary had been willing to share her menu, she could have optimized her cream puff ideas for potential customers before launching. And she could have stirred up even more hype and brand recognition for Dream Puffs on her opening day. Thanks, Thought Bubble! It's easy for us to judge a story, but who would you share an idea with? Your mom? Your trusted friends? Everyone on your morning bus ride? After all, a bus is just a limo full of friends you haven't met yet. It depends on the idea, but generally at this early stage, we want to target two main types of people. First, customers who might have the problem we're trying to solve, and second, people who can help us think through our idea. For example, we could look for a college campus with professors in entrepreneurship or entrepreneurial consulting, or turn to entrepreneurial networking groups like those in co-working spaces. And in the U.S., we have small business development centers. All around the world, you can check with your local government for similar organizations that provide education and financing for budding entrepreneurs. All these options are well-connected in the entrepreneurial community, and it's their goal to mentor, consult, and connect fledgling entrepreneurs. Do not be afraid to reach out and ask for help. But before we get carried away, we have to remember, we're still making sure that our idea is good and talking with potential customers. This is not the finance stage. We aren't asking people for seed money... yet. The next step in workshopping an idea is to think big about the fundamental pieces of your business, and a great way to do that is with a business plan tool like the Business Model Canvas, a lean startup template created by a company called Strategizer. Okay, cool, yeah, I'll fill that out in a second, I'm just finishing page 22 of my business plan where I discuss exactly which bees will provide the honey I need to use to sweeten the tea in my swanky cat cafe. Hate to break it to you, but the days of 30-page business plans are pretty much over, even if someday you need financing from a bank or a venture capitalist. Most lenders care about your story, proof your idea works and is wanted, an understanding of your customers, and your financial plan, which often takes 5-10 pages tops. And the Business Model Canvas has sections for all of those things. Really, filling out a business plan or business model canvas lets you collect all your thoughts about your idea and visualize how your business might exist. Let's explore the canvas using a little company you've probably never heard of, Netflix. For each section, we need to answer a key question. We'll start with value proposition. What is the value we deliver to our customers? Basically, why do they want whatever we're selling? Netflix leverages technology for global audiences who want on-demand, customized entertainment. Next, we move to the cluster for customers. Let's think about our people in three pieces. First, who even are they? All the types of people interested in our product form the Customer Segment section. In 2019, over 50% of Netflix's business came from subscribers outside the U.S. They use internal algorithms to predict and offer certain programs to certain demographics. Once we decide who our customers are, it's time to define the relationship in the Customer Relationship section. What type of relationship do our customers expect us to establish? Netflix customers expect quality programming, good predictive suggestions, excellent customer service, and high-end technology performance. And then, through what channels are we going to speak to them? How are we reaching our customers? Netflix uses emails, streaming apps, and social media campaigns to communicate with customers. They're even on Snapchat. Now that we know the who, we need to describe the infrastructure of our business, which also has three pieces. To start with the basics, what do we actually do? These are our key activities. Netflix licenses existing content and creates their own that they then deliver through an online platform. And they do all the usual business things like sales and marketing. After that, we have to decide what do we need to do those things. These are our key resources. Netflix relies on so many resources to keep their massive wheels turning. They have people making content, including their in-house studios, engineers to make sure their website and apps work, customer service to troubleshoot, attorneys to deal with licensing, internal teams for promotion, and a global network of data storage facilities. Then, remember, we don't have to do this alone. We need to look for key partners and ask, who do we need to team up with in order to deliver our value proposition? Netflix partners with law firms, studios, agents of actors, and other companies who want to co-promote products, like Comcast Xfinity or T-Mobile. Finally, after we've figured out the who and the what of our business model, we have to think about money. Half of that is our revenue streams. Where are we making money? What are customers willing to pay for each product or service? As of 2019, Netflix uses three membership subscriptions, Basic, which is $7.99 a month, Standard, $10.99 a month, and Premium, $13.99 a month. Unfortunately, entrepreneurship isn't free. There are costs involved in doing things for your people. So where are we going to spend the money? For Netflix, examples of costs are employees, licensing and production fees for content, servers for data storage, brick-and-mortar workplace locations, DVD production and mail, and R&D. And that is Netflix in a nutshell. This is exactly the goal of the Business Model Canvas, to provide a framework for anyone to break down the pieces of a business, especially your future business. Today, we grew the tiny seed of an idea into a full business model. So remember that everyone has ideas, and the real work of an entrepreneur is sharing them and getting lots of feedback. Next time, we'll figure out what you're worth.

6e5c117b-08e8-4e81-b27d-4516c6c100ed,"Hi, I'm Clint Smith and this is Crash Course Black American History. Today's lesson is steeped in philosophy. Now before you get too stressed out because philosophy seems overly complex and abstract, you should remind yourself that we actually wrestle with philosophical questions every day. Like, why did the chicken cross the road? Or what came first, the chicken or the egg? Or if you're my toddler, if I eat a lot of chicken, will I turn into a chicken? We've also seen great leaders throughout history challenge one another based on philosophies that they live by, like Thomas Jefferson vs. Alexander Hamilton, or even that short-lived spat between Captain America and Iron Man. In this episode, we'll unpack the competing philosophies of Booker T. Washington and W. E.B. Du Bois, two great political leaders in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time when many black Americans were still trying to figure out the best way to be a part of this country. INTRO In this scenario, Booker T. Washington, civil rights activist, philosopher, and writer, is the proverbial chicken that came before Du Bois' egg. Or the egg before the chicken. Anyway, you know what I mean. Washington was born in Franklin County, Virginia in 1856 to an enslaved woman. His father, from what we know, was a white man who he didn't know. In 1865, after emancipation, Washington's family relocated to West Virginia when he was nine years old, and where he worked in the mines as a child. Washington also attended local schools and colleges, including Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia, before going to Wayland Seminary in Washington, D.C. Washington's philosophy was centered on the idea of self-sufficiency. He emphasized black economic freedom and argued that black Americans would gain acceptance and economic stability in society through their skills and labor. He famously advocated for this approach in the 1895 Atlanta Compromise speech, in which Washington pushed for black uplift through self-improvement and attempting to dignify and glorify common labor, as opposed to attempting to directly challenge and fight back against Jim Crow segregation. People tend to give Washington a hard time about this, and in some ways, that's understandable. But we should remember the larger context of this moment. This was a period of time when black lynchings were peaking throughout the South. Many black folks were scared, and as the most prominent black leader, Washington was trying to reassure the larger white community that if they just let black people be, farm their land, work their jobs, and get a basic education, they wouldn't push back against the larger Jim Crow system. But just because he championed gaining acceptance from whites through industriousness and labor, that didn't mean he was necessarily keen on the idea of black people integrating into the larger white community. Again, he was thinking of black economic stability, but also safety from racial violence. In the Atlanta Compromise speech, he said, quote, ""...in all things that are purely social, we can be as separate as the fingers, yet one as the hand, in all things essential to mutual progress."" He was basically saying, you all do your thing, we'll do our thing, and everything will be okay. Cool. Washington later wrote in his essay, Industrial Education for the Negro, ""...for years to come, the education of the people of my race should be so directed that the greatest proportion of the mental strength of the masses will be brought to bear upon the everyday practical things of life, upon something that is needed to be done, and something which they will be permitted to do in the community in which they reside."" Washington published his seminal work, Up from Slavery, in 1901. In this book, he urged black people in the South to obey segregation laws and show deference to white authorities to keep the peace. And while Washington's philosophies gained a pretty substantial following, those ideas weren't enough for the people who wanted to see more immediate change. In fact, other black leaders of the time felt his approach was way too submissive. They believed that a stronger, more direct approach was necessary in order for black people to achieve true equality and civil rights. The most outspoken critic of Washington's work would be the sociologist and civil rights leader W.E.B. Du Bois. When we look at Du Bois' background, it becomes more clear how he had a difficult time relating to what Washington was advocating for. Born in 1868, three years after the Civil War, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, Du Bois didn't have the same direct experience with slavery that Washington did. We should name it directly, Washington was born into slavery and Du Bois was not. And these two realities played a large role in shaping how each of them would imagine the best way for black people to achieve upward mobility. Du Bois' mother was a domestic laborer, and his father was a barber who left the family when Du Bois was very young. Like Washington, Du Bois excelled in his studies and had aspirations of attaining higher education. Members of his community and several churches raised money for his college tuition, which helped him to actualize his goals. He attended the historically black Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, where he got his first bachelor's, and then Harvard University, where he got his second bachelor's, and then later, his PhD. He became the first black person to receive a doctorate in the history of Harvard. This is also where I got my PhD a few years ago. And I remember standing in front of the home where Du Bois used to live and thinking about how he paved the way for folks like me to be able to attend a place like this. Du Bois, who also spent time in graduate school studying under the tutelage of world-renowned social scientists in Berlin, wanted to use his scholarship to study how black people lived in America and illuminate the realities that they were subjected to. In fact, his 1899 work, The Philadelphia Negro, remains one of the most significant studies of sociology, and many scholars think of him as one of the founding fathers of the discipline. But that was far from Du Bois' only scholarly contribution. Perhaps his most widely known idea came from his 1903 book The Souls of Black Folk. And that idea is known as double consciousness. He describes the mechanism as a veil, stating, quote, The Negro is a sort of seventh son, born with a veil and gifted with second sight in this American world, a world which yields him no self-consciousness, but only lets him see himself through the revelation of the other world. It is a peculiar sensation, this double consciousness, this sense of always looking at oneself through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One feels his own twoness, an American, a Negro, two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings, two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps her from being torn asunder. In short, double consciousness captures the cognitive dissonance of being Black in America. You're American, you're Black, and you live in a country where there are always people and systems reminding you, in ways large and small, that those two identities are incompatible. And as important as Du Bois' work has been, some of it did fall short of being inclusive of all Black people. Du Bois, for example, proposed this idea of the Talented Tenth, which he outlined in a piece that he contributed to a 1903 book entitled The Negro Problem, a collection of essays, ironically, in which Washington's industrial education for the Negro also appeared. Du Bois emphasized the necessity for higher education in the humanities to develop the leadership capacity among the most capable 10% of Black men. He wrote, The Negro race, like all races, is going to be saved by its exceptional men. The problem of education, then, among Negroes, must first of all deal with the Talented Tenth. It is the problem of developing the best of this race that they may guide the mass away from the contamination and death of the worst. Du Bois believed that Black people would be led and uplifted by the most talented and classically trained men of the race. This framework, though, was questionable. First off, Du Bois was only referring to men. Secondly, he had this idea that being college-educated and classically trained was the best way for Black people to reach their full potential. And that's just a narrow and pretty misguided way to think about Black mobility. Based on this belief, he established a group of elites called the Niagara Movement in 1905. Additionally, he was also among the most prominent political leaders who founded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1909. And while the NAACP remains an important organization in America today, people largely reject the idea that only the elite, in any community, can make change. And to his credit, later in his life, Du Bois would attempt to clarify and kind of walk back some of this original framing, in order to think more inclusively about what Black upward mobility could look like. The truth is, both of these men, for all of the flaws that we might now look back and see in their respective frameworks, were attempting to do the best that they could on behalf of communities they loved and cared about. And it's worth noting that it's not like Washington didn't care about civil rights. It's just that the sort of agitation that Du Bois advocated for, demanding immediate social and political change, had different risk implications in the South. Washington feared that any sort of confrontation between Black and white people would end up in disaster for Black people, and that some semblance of cooperation with white America was how Black people could stave off racial violence. What some don't know, however, and that what scholars have more recently brought to light, is that, secretly, Washington funded and supported civil rights cases that attempted to give Black people the right to vote. But still, the competing visions of Washington and Du Bois helped make clear that Black thinking, Black politics, Black philosophy, and Black conceptions of how to make progress in America are not, and have never been, monolithic. Black life in America is made better with Black folks of all different sensibilities advocating for a more just society. Both Washington and Du Bois' contributions laid the groundwork for many of the Black leaders who would come after them. Leaders who would learn from both the positive, and not-so-positive, aspects of each of the men's work. Thanks for watching, I'll see you next time.

2769a5ac-50cd-4598-bb42-1743313c24c0,"Hey there, I'm Jabril, and I am John Green-bot, and welcome to Crash Course Artificial Intelligence. Now, I want to make sure we're starting on the same page. Artificial intelligence is everywhere. It's helping banks make loan decisions, and helping doctors diagnose patients. It's on our cell phones, autocompleting text. It's the algorithm recommending videos for you to watch after this one. AI already has a pretty huge impact on all of our lives. So people, understandably, have some polarized feelings about it. Some of us imagine that AI will change the world in positive ways. It could end car accidents because we have self-driving cars. Or it could give the elderly great personalized care. Others worry that AI will lead to constant surveillance by Big Brother government, some say the automation will take all of our jobs, or the robots might try and kill us all. No, we're not worried about you, John Green-bot. But when we interact with AI that's currently available like Siri... Hey Siri, is AI going to kill us all? I don't understand, is AI going to kill us all? It's clear that those are still distant futures. Now, to understand where artificial intelligence might be headed, and our role in the AI revolution, we have to understand how we got to where we are today. INTRO If you know about artificial intelligence mostly from movies or books, AI probably seems like this vague label for any machine that can think like a human. Fiction writers like to imagine a more generalized AI, one that can answer any question you might have and do anything a human can do. But that's a pretty rigid way to think about AI, and it's not super realistic. Sorry John Green-bot, you can't do all that yet. A machine is said to have artificial intelligence if it can interpret data, potentially learn from the data, and use that knowledge to adapt and achieve specific goals. Now, the idea of learning from the data is kind of a new approach, but we'll get more into that in episode 4. So, let's say we load a new program into John Green-bot. This program looks at a bunch of photos of me, and some of not of me, and then learns from the data. Then we can show him a new photo, like this selfie of me here in the studio filming this Crash Course video, and we'll see if he can recognize if the photo is me. If he can correctly classify that new photo, we can say that John Green-bot has some artificial intelligence. Of course, that's a very specific input of photos, and a very specific task of classifying a photo that's either me or not me. With just that program, John Green-bot can't recognize or name anyone who isn't me. You. Are. Not. Jabril. He can't navigate to places, or hold a meaningful conversation. No, I just don't get it. Why would anyone choose a bagel when you have a perfectly good donut right here? You. Are. Jabril. Thanks, John Green-bot. He can't do most things that humans do, which is pretty standard for AI these days. But even with this much more limited definition of artificial intelligence, AI still plays a huge role in our everyday lives. There are some more obvious uses for AI, like Alexa or Roomba, which is kind of like the AI from science fiction, I guess. But there are also a ton of less obvious examples. When we buy something in a big store or online, we have one type of AI deciding which and how many items to stock. And as we scroll through Instagram, a different type of AI picks ads to show us. AI helps determine how expensive our car insurance is, or whether we get approved for a loan. And AI even affects big life decisions. Like when you submit your college or job application, AI might be screening it before a human even sees it. The way AI and automation are changing commerce and jobs is sort of like the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century. This change is global. Some people are excited about it, and others are afraid of it. But either way, we all have a responsibility to understand AI and figure out what role AI will play in our lives. The AI revolution itself isn't even that old. The term artificial intelligence didn't even exist a century ago. It was coined in 1956 by a computer scientist named John McCarthy. He used it to name the Dartmouth Research Project on Artificial Intelligence. Most people just call it the Dartmouth Conference for short. Now, this is way more than a weekend where you listen to a few talks and maybe go to a networking dinner. Back in the day, academics got together to think for a while. The conference lasted eight weeks and got a bunch of computer scientists, cognitive psychologists, and mathematicians to join forces. Many of the concepts that we'll talk about in Crash Course AI, like artificial neural networks, were dreamed up and developed during this conference and in the few years that followed. But because these excited academics were pretty optimistic about artificial intelligence, they may have oversold it a bit. For example, Marvin Minsky was a talented cognitive scientist who was a part of the Dartmouth Conference. But he had some ridiculously wrong predictions about technology, and specifically AI. In 1970, he claimed that in three to eight years, we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being. And sorry, Marvin, but we're not even close to that now. Scientists at the Dartmouth Conference seriously underestimated how much data and computing power an AI would need to solve complex real-world problems. See, artificial intelligence doesn't really know anything when it's created. Kind of like a human baby. Babies use their senses to perceive the world and their bodies to interact with it. And they learn from the consequences of their actions. My baby niece might put a strawberry in her mouth and decide that it's tasty. And then she might put Play-Doh in her mouth and decide that it's gross. Babies experience millions of these data-gathering events as they learn to speak, walk, think, and not eat Play-Doh. Now, most kinds of artificial intelligence don't have things like senses, a body, or a brain that can automatically judge a lot of different things like a human baby does. Modern AI systems are just programs and machines. So, we need to give an AI a lot of data. Plus, we have to label the data with whatever information the AI is trying to learn, like whether food tastes good to humans. And then, the AI needs a powerful enough computer to make sense of all the data. All of this just wasn't available in 1956. Back then, an AI could maybe tell the difference between a triangle and a circle, but it definitely couldn't recognize my face in the photo like John Green-bot did earlier. So, until about 2010 or so, the field was basically frozen in what's called the AI winter. Still, there were a lot of changes in the last half a century that led us to the AI revolution. As a friend once said, history reminds us that revolutions are not so much events as they are processes. The AI revolution didn't begin with a single event, idea, or invention. We got to where we are today because of lots of small decisions and two big developments in computing. The first development was a huge increase in computing power and how fast computers could process data. To see just how huge, let's go to the Thought Bubble. During the Dartmouth Conference in 1956, the most advanced computer was the IBM 7090. It filled a whole room, stored data on basically giant cassette tapes, and took instructions using paper punch cards. Every second, the IBM 7090 could do about 200,000 operations. But if you tried to do that, it would take you 55 and a half hours, assuming you did one operation per second and took no breaks. That's right, not even for snacks. At the time, this was enough computing power to help with the U.S. Air Force Ballistic Missile Warning System. But AI needs to do a lot more computations with a lot more data. The speed of a computer is linked to the number of transistors it has to do operations. Every two years or so since 1956, engineers have doubled the number of transistors that can fit in the same amount of space. So computers have gotten much faster. When the first iPhone was released in 2007, it could do about 400 million operations per second. But 10 years later, Apple says the iPhone X's processor can do about 600 billion operations per second. That's like having the computing power of over a thousand original iPhones in your pocket. For all the nerds out there, listen, you're right. It's not quite that simple. We're just talking about flops here. And a modern supercomputer, which does computational functions like the IBM 7090 did, can do over 30 quadrillion operations per second. To put it another way, a program that would have taken a modern supercomputer one second to compute would have taken the IBM 7090 4,753 years. Thanks, Thought Bubble. So computers started to have enough computing power to mimic certain brain functions with artificial intelligence in 2005. And that's when the AI winters started to show signs of thawing. But it doesn't really matter if you have a powerful computer, unless you also have a lot of data for it to munch on. The second development that kicked off the AI revolution is something that you're using right now, the internet and social media. In the past 20 years, our world has become much more interconnected. Whether you livestream from your phone or just use a credit card, we're all participating in the modern world. Every time we upload a photo, click a link, tweet a hashtag, tweet without a hashtag, like a video on YouTube, tag a friend on Facebook, argue on Reddit, post on TikTok, RIP Vine, support a Kickstarter campaign, buy snacks on Amazon, call Uber from a party, and basically anything that generates data. Even when we do something that seems like it's offline, like applying for a loan to buy a new car or using a password at the airport, those datasets end up in a bigger system. The AI revolution is happening now, because we have this wealth of data and the computing power to make sense of it. And I get it. The idea that we're generating a bunch of data, but don't always know how, why, or if it's being used by computer programs can be kind of overwhelming. But through Crash Course AI, we want to learn how artificial intelligence works, because it's impacting our lives in huge ways, and that impact will only continue to grow. With knowledge, we can make small decisions to help guide the AI revolution, instead of feeling like we're riding on a roller coaster we didn't even sign up for. We're creating the future of artificial intelligence together, every single day, which I think is pretty cool. Next time, we'll start to dive into technical ideas like supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, and we'll discuss what makes a machine learning algorithm good. See you then.

df6527fb-3c8e-457d-8928-551b000242b2,"This image is called the Blue Marble, and it was taken in 1972 during the Apollo 17 mission. It has become a symbol not only of cool space travel, but the environmental movement back here on the ground. Think about it. When you're on the Earth, it seems pretty dang big and solid. But when seen from far above, it's just a blue marble, flecked with beautiful green. Inspiring, isolated, and not really all that big. And thanks to technologies like air travel and the internet, and to a booming human population, it keeps feeling smaller. And thanks to technologies and a booming human population, it keeps losing all those all-important green flecks. Today, our topic is the history of climate science, which leads to some dark questions about the future of life on Earth. INTRO Scientists tend to be conservative. Not politically conservative, but careful, resistant to big claims. So evidence for the possible end of the living world took a while to be seen as such. One problem was the structure of modern science. Remember how those ancient Greek, Indian, and Chinese natural philosophers tended to study astronomy, math, the living world, and human society all at once? By the 1900s, professional scientists had gone in the other direction—specialization. Scientists tended to focus on learning about one specific thing—often practically oriented things. Another problem was actually epistemic. Studying weather patterns in one region is useful. But how do you study global climate? How many local patterns add up to a global one? And there are so many elements involved in the Earth's systems—solar radiation, human activity, carbon, nitrogen, water—non-humans. How do you know which variables matter in answering any given question? Big data suddenly becomes not a source of potential answers, but a serious problem. So how did we get here? English inventor Guy Callender correctly predicted rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in 1938. He analyzed measurements of temperatures from the 19th century on, correlating them with measurements of carbon dioxide. He saw that temperature had increased, and proposed that this was an effect of increasing CO2. Most scientists were skeptical, but Callender died convinced he was onto something. And his work influenced a small number of scientists. In 1957, Ravel published a paper with Hans Suess suggesting that human emissions of greenhouse gases like CO2 might create a greenhouse effect. These heat-trapping gases would be trapped in the atmosphere, not absorbed quickly enough by the oceans, which would cause global warming. Ravel also convinced geochemist Charles Keeling to keep measuring atmospheric CO2 concentrations at Mauna Loa Observatory, starting in 1958. These measurements showed seasonal variation, as well as a clear arc over time. The planet is warming, and CO2 is rising. This trend is called the Keeling Curve. In 1988, the World Meteorological Organization established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, which has become the premier body for establishing just what is going on with the Earth's climate. And in 1996, the governments of the world came together to ban chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, a group of odorless chemicals that were used in hairsprays, refrigerators, and lots of other places, and that were causing a hole in the Earth's protective ozone layer. And by the 2000s, many scientists had overcome their conservatism to speak out about global shifts in climate, which were affecting living systems of all sorts, agriculture, cities, and, you know, everything. In 2000, atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen coined a term for these global shifts. And however imperfect, it has stuck—the Anthropocene, or the Age of Man. Some scholars have called into question the naming of this era after the human, as if all humans are equally to blame. There have been some other pretty good contenders for the naming of this age—Donna Haraway's The Cthulhucene, or the Age of Science-Fictional Badness, the Manthropocene, or the Age of Dudes, which not-so-subtly hints at the gender bias in science, and—catching on with some historians—the Capitalocene, or the Age of Political Economics. This is a fight among historians over how to discuss longue durée history, or history across many millennia. It's also a fight among geologists about where to place the so-called golden spikes—moments that represent shifts in the very makeup of the Earth, usually visible shifts in the fossil record. In fact, the Anthropocene is kind of a political fight about the intersection of geological epochs and human history. The problem with the Anthropocene is that there are so many good candidates for the golden spike of a human epoch. Show us, Thought Bubble. First, there's the original fossil fuel, coal, which was mined extensively in certain regions starting in the late 1700s and ramping up seriously in the late 1800s, the Industrial Revolution. Second, there's radioactive material in the form of strontium-90, which could be traced all over the world soon after the Trinity Atomic Bomb Test, the first of many such tests. So this date for the beginning of the Anthropocene would be the specific date of July 16, 1945, the day of the Trinity Test, and the birth of the Cold War. Third, there's plastic, steel, and concrete, but especially plastic. Humans built stuff and even had plastic before World War II, but development took off at an unprecedented pace around 1960. This great acceleration saw rapid, often exponential growth in human population, use of fresh water, ability to produce and move food, greenhouse gas emissions, temperature of the Earth's surface, and consumption of all kinds of natural resources. The period of the Great Acceleration also gave rise to the first megacities, or urban areas with over 10 million people. In reaction to massive urbanization, humans have also set aside more land as national parks or greenways, creating a landscape dominated by industrial agriculture and cities, but also sporting well-defined breaks of deep green. All of these changes can be seen in the Earth's geological record, and they all symbolize how some humans have changed the physical world. But perhaps the best candidate is for… Chicken bones. With more than 23 billion alive at any time, chickens, whose bodies have been heavily designed by humans, are the most common terrestrial vertebrate species on the planet. Aliens visiting the ruins of Earth could reasonably conclude from our fossil record that the only life form that ever mattered on this planet was the chicken. Thanks, Thought Bubble. But the Anthropocene is only one way of viewing geological change and human disruption of natural cycles. Also influential are the planetary boundaries, a set of nine specific ranges for natural processes within which humans can definitely live. These include measures such as climate change, ocean acidification, and ozone depletion, but also the genetic diversity of life on Earth, and how much land is converted to cropland. But we can't talk about climate disruption without mentioning the pushback. Even though the vast majority of scientists realize that humans have had a tremendous impact on the Earth, politically conservative talk shows run stories about how there's no consensus. So where did this idea come from? In 2010, geologist and historian of science Naomi Oreskes and NASA historian Eric Conway showed that fossil fuel companies had hired some of the same PR agents and strategists who had worked for tobacco companies decades earlier to invent climate denial. That is, to create doubt about the science that was not doubted by scientists. Ultimately, climate science isn't just about long-term shifts in the movement of carbon, water, heat, and other natural phenomena. The big questions for scientists in the capitalist scene include epistemic, technical, and moral ones. Epistemic questions include how fast are humans—especially humans working within capitalism—changing which ecosystems and in what ways? For example, we know that many important pollinators, such as honeybees, bumblebees, and butterflies are dying out. Which is sad, but also potentially an enormous problem. And we have some ideas as to why. A major cause is off-target damage from pesticides, which—no surprise—literally are made to kill bugs. But which pesticides affect which bugs in which ways? Are there safe options? Can we test lots of different ways of doing agriculture and see which ones are most bug-friendly? And which forms of agriculture are most likely to erode soil from the land, and which are helping build the soil back up? Basically, what kinds of knowledge do we need to make today, in a connected, fragile, and increasingly disrupted world? In terms of technical questions, earth scientists are increasingly being pushed from the role of description to recommending action. Some prominent scientists are calling for governments to seriously consider geoengineering—also known as climate engineering—the intentional, global-scale transformation of the environment to combat global warming and other disruptions. Some geoengineering would be relatively uncontroversial, like creating more forests. But other ideas have been hotly debated, like fertilizing the ocean with iron to accelerate the growth of algae, thus capturing more CO2 from the atmosphere. But perhaps the biggest shift in professional sciencing today is moral. Who should pay for solutions to global-scale problems such as sea-level rise and global warming? Everyone? Or only the people who most contributed to the problem? The Yellow Vest Movement in France is a recent example of this conflict. People across the country were subject to a new tax on fuel, in order to help lower carbon emissions. But many of the working poor, especially in more rural areas, simply couldn't afford to pay more to get around, and riots broke out. And think about all of the scientists working on topics related to the environment. But maybe on the wrong side of history. What if you're a professional geologist, and Exxon, BP, or Shell hired you to find more fossil fuels to extract? Should you not do the science you've already spent a decade getting really good at? This isn't a portrait of doomsday, but a call to reflect on science's strengths and its limits. Science alone can't answer tough questions about how humanity should address climate disruption, and who should pay for potential solutions. One thing is certain. Whether we call it the Anthropocene, the Capitalocene, or the Cthulhocene, the new era in which some humans have dragged the blue marble, will forever change how we make and share knowledge and tools. Next time, we'll finish the series with a look at how science is gendered. Not only how important women have been to the history of science, and how difficult it is to sometimes tell their stories, but also how our understandings of the natural world reflect our ideas about humanity.

e4be0c26-a2c1-4dff-95f9-b55cce2e53f3,"Hi, I'm Clint Smith and this is Crash Course Black American History. Today we're going to be talking about the Louisiana Rebellion of 1811, which was the largest slave revolt in American history. The Louisiana Rebellion of 1811, also known as the German Coast Uprising, was epic by all accounts. On what was called Epiphany Sunday, some emboldened enslaved men reached an epiphany like no other. They were determined to take the city of New Orleans and burn everything else down in the process. Let's check it out. I want to note up top that this episode will address some challenging topics and include descriptions of extreme violence. A few days after Epiphany Sunday, on a rainy evening the night of January 8th, 1811, hundreds of enslaved men took up arms, determined to secure their freedom. It is remarkable to consider that hundreds of enslaved people, who came from different countries, with different native languages, and different tribal affiliations, were able to organize themselves as effectively as they did. Dressed in military garb, this group marched through plantations from Louisiana's German coast all the way to New Orleans, and they gathered more soldiers as they went. On the German coast of Louisiana, where the rebellion took place, named as such for the German immigrants who settled there, roughly 60% of the total population was enslaved. The fear of armed insurrection had long been in the air. The leader of this rebellion was a mixed-race slave driver named Charles Delon. Delon had been inspired by the Haitian Revolution that ended only 7 years prior in 1804, a revolution in which black forces, who at various points had fought off the British, the Spanish, and the French, created the first nation to permanently ban slavery and would become the first black republic in the entire world. The German coast uprising revealed the Haitian Revolution's impact not only on the demographics of Louisiana, which up to that point had been importing enslaved workers from Haiti, but also how the success of the revolution fundamentally changed the trajectory of the U.S. and its history by making possible the Louisiana Purchase. See, in 1803, Thomas Jefferson purchased a huge chunk of North America from France. Whether he was allowed to do so under his presidential authority is up for debate. But in any case, Napoleon Bonaparte was in need of some money, after the Haitian Revolution had dashed his hopes of building a French empire in the New World. The French army was so beleaguered from battle and disease that by the end of the war, more than 80% of the soldiers sent to try and quell the Haitian Revolution had died. Napoleon Bonaparte, looking to cut his losses and refocus his attention on his military battles in Europe, sold the entire territory of Louisiana to Thomas Jefferson's negotiators for a paltry $15 million. Without the Haitian Revolution, it's really unlikely that Napoleon would have sold a land mass that doubled the size of the then United States, especially as Jefferson had only intended to approach the French basically looking to just purchase New Orleans in order to have access to the mouth of the Mississippi River. There were also many Haitians who emigrated to the U.S. in the years following the revolution. According to historian Manisha Sinha, the most direct consequence of the Haitian Revolution in the United States was the influx of refugees into cities like New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, and New Orleans. In other words, New Orleans, and much of southern Louisiana, had long-standing connections with Haiti. This tells us a lot about the climate at the time of the German Coast Uprising. A significant amount of the enslaved population had arrived soon after witnessing a slave uprising that led to the abolition of slavery and the establishment of a free country. So as I'm sure you can imagine, a number of the refugees that came to the United States were very much bringing the spirit of the Haitian Revolution alongside them. Historians aren't positive, but believe Charles Delon was born either in Saint-Domingue, current-day Haiti, or in Louisiana in 1787. Either way, by 1811, Charles was a slave driver on the plantation of Manuel Andry. Andry was known for the cruelty and violence he practiced on his plantation. But Charles was an overseer, which granted him more privileges than some other enslaved people. It also gave him the right to inflict punishment on other enslaved people. And while this did not mean he was exempt from Andry's cruelty or violence, his position granted him some relative power within the larger slave system. It was another one of the upsetting and insidious things about slavery, both to be tasked with inflicting violence on the enslaved, while you are enslaved yourself. What we find, however, is that in the context of this rebellion, Charles' position was essential in hatching and carrying out the plan. Black men sometimes occupied the role of overseer in the Deep South, which positioned them as a sort of middleman between the plantation owner and the plantation laborer. When enslaved laborers made plans to resist, they would usually have to communicate in code or in secret or in small groups to avoid getting caught by the overseer. But if the overseer is the one coming up with the plan, rather than the one trying to stop it, it's a whole different ballgame. But Charles didn't do this work alone. To pull off something like this, he would need help. And two enslaved men, named Cooke and Quamana, worked closely by Charles' side and emerged as influential leaders of this rebellion. So what was the plan? While it's difficult to know exactly because of limited documentation from the time, there is some important information that we do know. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. The Sunday just before the uprising, plantation owner James Brown spotted three men, Charles, Quamana, and Harry, an enslaved carpenter from Virginia, all meeting in secret. They packed into a small shack behind the big house of the Andry Plantation, while the rest of the enslaved population was out enjoying Epiphany Sunday. Enslaved Black people who grew their own crops in addition to their duties regularly met on Sundays in the marketplace to trade with one another. The marketplace, filled with a mix of African captives, Haitians, and native-born Black Americans, was not only a place to trade goods, but was also often a festive place with drums and singing and dancing. Spanish enslavers who were well experienced with trading and managing African captives thought that this was a bad idea, commenting that these celebratory proceedings could be masking real plans to rebel. And they were right, historians have noted that these dancing sessions could also serve as covert military training. From the time they arrived in 1806, Cooke and Quamana used such events to tap into the network of enslaved people from all over New Orleans. They immediately showed discontent for their enslaved status and took to the streets spreading the word of their plans to rebel away from the watchful eyes and listening ears of the white planter class. So we can't determine what exactly Charles and the others were saying in those secret meetings, but it's clear that it provided kindling for what would become one of the most explosive rebellions in American history. Thanks Thought Bubble. The rebellion began when between 15 and 25 enslaved men attacked Manuel Andry on his plantation. Though wounded, Andry managed to escape to warn the other plantation owners in his vicinity. Andry's son Gilbert, however, was killed. The rebels then broke into Manuel Andry's stores and stole weapons and militia uniforms. As they moved into St. Charles Parish, they amassed quite a following. While some available documents suggest that only 124 enslaved people participated, several eyewitness accounts attest to much larger numbers, closer to 500. As the men marched along the bends of the river, drums rumbling, flags held high above their heads, they attacked several plantations with an assortment of knives, machetes, muskets, and other scavenged weapons, killing two white men and destroying property in their wake. Still, not many of the enslaved fighters had guns, and it would only take a small number of armed troops to stop their liberatory march. And within 48 hours, local militia and federal troops had suppressed the rebellion. Gilan briefly escaped the initial wave of slaughter by hiding in the swamp, but was quickly captured and executed. His hands were chopped off, the bones in his legs were shattered by bullets, and he was burned over a bale of straw. Many of the rebels were slaughtered on sight, their heads cut off and posted on stakes that lined the levee, a warning to other enslaved people that this was the price to pay for rebellion. General Professor Samuel Hambledon wrote, They were brung here for the sake of their heads, which decorate our levee, all the way up the coast. They look like crows sitting on long poles. Commodore Shaw captured the planters' sense of fear that pushed them to respond with such violence against those who had participated in the insurrection and made an example to the larger enslaved population. Had not the most prompt and energetic measures been thus taken, the whole coast would have exhibited a general sense of devastation. Every description of property would have been consumed, and the country laid waste by rioters. The backlash was brutal. Alarmed enslavers in Louisiana invested deep resources in training local militia, and slave patrols began surveilling Black people with increasing frequency, in addition to limiting their ability to congregate in large groups. Meanwhile, the federal government committed to defending the institution of slavery by officially granting Louisiana statehood as a slave state in 1812. Unlike some other rebellions that have become central to our collective memory of slavery in this country, the 1811 slave revolt has received far less attention. As we mentioned, there are no real notes of what was said between the co-conspirators, and we don't have much that gives us insight into what Charles may have been thinking. So while scholars are unclear why Charles would have been willing to give up the security that his position gave him, what is clear is that, for him, tearing down the institution was worth risking it all. So was the 1811 uprising a success? As we've said before, notions of what is or isn't a successful slave revolt are subjective and kind of less important than the fact that the rebellion took place at all. Because while they may not have been able to take the city, they certainly dealt a blow to the system, and one that would change the entire framework of the institution for years to come.

fa6e9a4d-37d4-446b-88ae-2c9be8ee90b0,"Hi, my name is Clint Smith and this is Crash Course Black American History. So, if you look at the tag on the shirt that you're wearing, you'll probably find that at least a portion of it is made of cotton. I mean, cotton is everywhere. It's in our shirts, in our pants, in curtains, in blankets, in so many other things that we don't even realize. But even though that cotton on your back was meant to keep you comfortable, the historical reality of the United States is that the cotton industry was built on the backs of black folks. A lot of cotton is grown in the hot and humid climate of the southern United States, and a lot of this country's wealth was built on the cotton trade. But it's easy to forget that part of the reason that cotton was so lucrative in early America was because it was harvested with the labor of enslaved people. And even though the dirty work of the cotton industry took place mainly in the southern states, many white people in the northern United States gained their fortunes through the exploitation of enslaved workers in the south. And the reason that cotton became such a central economic pillar was not just because of what was happening in the US, but because of an entire global financial network that, whether they sanctioned the use of slavery themselves or not, incentivized the use of enslaved labor to satisfy the enormous international demand for cotton. It's time we learn about how cotton became king. Let's start the show. Intro By the time of the Civil War, the United States was wealthy. I'm talking Scrooge McDuck swimming in golden coins rich. It had become one of the major slave trading capitals of the world and a major exporter of cotton. According to scholar Henry Louis Gates, cotton was the first mass consumer commodity. Which is just a fancy way of saying that everybody in the world wanted it. They wanted it for their clothes, for their blankets, for their rugs, for their socks. I mean, demand across the globe was exploding. The cotton industry was so powerful that it not only grew the US economy, but many economies in Europe as well. But most nations couldn't compete with the United States production level. According to historian Edward Baptist, the North American interior had thousands of acres of possible cotton fields, thousands for each one in the Caribbean. And in order to develop all of this land, there was a greater need for laborers to work the cotton plantations of the South and Mid-Atlantic United States. And as had become standard practice in the US in the 18th and 19th centuries, the plan was for most of these laborers to be enslaved black people. Enslaved labor and cotton went hand in hand to produce profit. And the work, it was more than just backbreaking, it was torture. Charles Ball, a black man and author who escaped slavery, wrote that the brutality of the cotton industry was enough to make an individual contemplate taking their own life. He said in his 1837 autobiography, Slavery in the United States, quote, Surely if anything can justify a man in taking his life into his own hands and terminating his existence, no one can attach blame to the slaves on many of the cotton plantations of the South when they cut short their breath and the agonies of the present being by a single stroke. What is life worth amidst hunger, nakedness, and excessive toil under the continually uplifted lash? It really doesn't get more clear than that. And in 1793, the cotton gin arrived, and it transformed the cotton industry, the global economy, and in horrific ways, the lives of enslaved people. The cotton gin significantly ramped up cotton production in the United States, especially in South Carolina and Georgia. Let's check that out in the Thought Bubble. Before 1793, separating the sticky seeds from cotton was a laborious task. Then, the mechanical cotton gin invented by Eli Whitney made the process much faster and easier than it had ever been. What would happen is that cotton would be threaded through a wooden drum filled with hooks that caught hold of the fibers and pulled them through a mesh. The holes in that mesh were too small to allow the seeds through, but the cotton fibers themselves were easily pulled through. While some larger gins would later be powered by horses and even steam engines, Whitney used a smaller version. Whitney's hand-cranked machine could remove the seeds from 50 pounds of cotton in a single day. What this meant was that planters needed a way to grow and pick more cotton to keep up with the new accelerated pace of processing. And at the same time, market conditions in Europe meant cotton was more desirable than ever. What this meant was that planters needed even more labor from even more enslaved workers than they did before. Demand for other industrial cotton machinery grew as well, like new machines for spinning cotton or steamboats to transport massive bales of it. This drastically changed the American economic landscape. By the 1850s, cotton provided three-fifths of American exports, and the yield of raw cotton doubled every decade after 1800. By some estimates, the United States supplied three-quarters of the global supply of cotton by the start of the Civil War. If cotton wasn't king before, it certainly was now. Thanks, Thought Bubble. The economic impact of the cotton industry on the United States and the enslaved people whose labor sustained it is very clear. Again, historian Edward Baptist writes, All told, more than $600 million, or almost half of the economic activity in the United States in 1836, derived directly or indirectly from cotton produced by the million-odd slaves, 6 percent of the total U.S. population who in that year toiled in labor camps on slavery's frontier. And again, it wasn't just the United States, it was the world. Most of the Western world's economies benefited from the cotton industry. Historian Gene Dattle argues that cotton produced by enslaved people was the driving force for territorial expansion in the Old Southwest and fostered trade between Europe and the United States. Major northern cities, like New York City, needed raw cotton for their own industries. New England was also seriously dependent on raw cotton for the textile revolution. New England mills consumed 283.7 million pounds of cotton, or 67 percent of the cotton used by U.S. mills in 1860. So any notion that the North wasn't intimately involved in slavery is something we should immediately toss out the window. Abroad, countries like Britain and France also depended on raw cotton. According to Gene Dattle, Britain, the most powerful nation in the world, relied on slave-produced cotton for over 80 percent of its essential industrial raw material. English textile mills accounted for 40 percent of Britain's exports. One-fifth of Britain's 22 million people were directly or indirectly involved with cotton textiles. And it didn't stop there. One of the main causes of the Civil War was cotton, and the status of the enslaved laborers who produced that cotton. Southern slaveholders were so financially attached to the cotton industry that they were willing to go to war over it. And at the end of the war, cotton was one of the bargaining tools that the South used to assure that they would still have a place, and political power, in the Union. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. We'll get to the Civil War soon. Now, let's do some deeper thinking about the economic implications of slavery. In 1860, in large part tied to the explosion of the cotton industry, the 4 million enslaved people in the United States were worth more than all of the railroads and factories in the nation combined. Those enslaved workers were worth more than all of the manufacturing in the United States. So Black people's labor has played an enormous role in America's ascent as a global economic superpower. But enslaved people themselves didn't get to reap the benefits of the economic explosion they created. The vast majority of Black folks were not allowed to own any property. And if they did, it could be seized from them at any moment, without them being able to do much of anything about it. Even when slavery was abolished, the sharecropping system in the South worked in similar ways, plunging Black Americans and their families into devastating debt while they owned nothing of their own. The implications of this are profound. Let's step back and consider that intergenerational chattel slavery in the United States, in which Black people rarely owned their own land, lasted for 250 years before ending, technically at least, in 1865. Let's then consider that sharecropping, in which enormous numbers of Black people continued to not own their own land, lasted well into the 1950s and arguably later. This directly impacts generational wealth in the United States today. If your family was able to accrue income, equity, and mobility by owning land that produced cotton, or any other crop for that matter, and then pass it down across generations, it would quite naturally leave your descendants in a more economically secure position than those who came before them. But Black folks, despite working the land, cultivating the land, and picking the cotton and crops that grew on the land, for the most part, didn't have any opportunity to reap the financial benefits of that land. What this did was leave many Black families, well after slavery ended and into the 20th century, with little, if anything, to pass down to their children, something that shapes the sort of opportunities that their descendants would or would not have. And this gap between White and Black people is compounded decade after decade after decade until it's no longer a gap in wealth, it's a gulf. Cotton was the United States' biggest export for more than a century. That's more than 100 years of wealth creation and industry that Black Americans not only carried on their backs, but were designated to never profit from. I mean, calling it a head start for White people doesn't even accurately capture it. It wasn't just a head start, it was like you were running while the person you're racing against had chains on their feet and death threats in their ears. So when we talk about creating a more equitable nation, part of what we have to think about is how to account for, and make amends for, what was done to people and what was kept from people for generations. The question remains, how can we compensate those who this country purposefully left behind? Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.

bffaa0dc-b850-47ab-b48c-78d2f734d589,"I grew up in Ithaca, New York, in the US, where there's a huge variety of landscapes. There are farms and forests and mountains and lakes and massive waterfalls all within a pretty small region. But swimming in the Finger Lakes right in my backyard in the summer, or visiting New York City on field trips, I had no idea that the land I was walking on was actually shaped by glaciers. We'll come back to New York later, but it won't be our only example because actually many of the Earth's landscapes were shaped by glaciers in some way or another millions of years ago. And today, they're like icy 21st century canaries in the coal mine warning us about the massive changes to our world that are coming as climates change and sea levels rise. These behemoth globs of compressed ice and snow moving across the land created fertile soils and physical features while also serving as frozen time capsules. They recorded both Earth's climatic history over several million years and contained clues to its climatic future. I'm Alizé Carrère and this is Crash Course Geography. INTRO Our journey through physical geography is almost over, and by now we definitely know the Earth is ever-changing. And glaciers have often been a crucial part of that change. Basically, a glacier is a large mass of ice that formed from compressed snow that moves thanks to its own weight and the pull of gravity. And there are actually two main types. When we find a glacier in a mountain range, it's called an alpine or mountain glacier. And on a larger scale, a continuous mass of unconfined ice bigger than 50,000 square kilometers is called a continental glacier or ice sheet. In 2021, about 10% of the Earth's land surface is ice. Most of that's found in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. And glaciers have a big influence on our global climate. Because glaciers covered in snow are so dazzlingly white, they reflect a lot of the solar radiation they get, keeping the Earth cool. And we saw in our weather episodes how the enormous temperature difference between the polar regions and the warm equatorial regions drives the system of heat transport around the world. And like we learned in our last episode on groundwater, only 2.8% of the Earth's water is freshwater. A tiny bit of that is in lakes and rivers, and almost a third is groundwater. But all the rest is locked in glaciers. So if all the world's glaciers were to melt, sea levels would rise about 70 meters, changing ocean circulation patterns, which would alter weather and climate in the mid-latitudes. Not to mention create political, economic, and social upheaval, dramatically reshaping coastlines and the lives of over 2.4 billion people who live within 100 kilometers of a coast. Looking to the past, it was glaciers themselves that provided the first inkling there had been big changes in global climates throughout Earth's history. Many naturalists, and even a poet, during the early 19th century were struck by the fact that the British Isles and the North German Plains, which are areas far from glaciers even today, had deeply eroded U-shaped valleys, massive erratic boulders far from where they formed, and bedrock that was smooth like it had been polished by abrasion. These features were similar to what was seen in the Alps where there were still glaciers, and they concluded that it was evidence that the British Isles and North German Plains also had icy pasts. Today we know the most recent ice age is one of several ice ages that Earth has experienced in its long history. And it doesn't mean that Earth has to be entirely covered in ice. An ice age alternates between glaciations, or a period when temperatures drop and ice sheets grow and spread outwards over vast areas, and interglaciations, when the climate is milder. And this back and forth between glaciations and interglaciations means an ice age can last for millions of years. Right now, we're actually still in an ice age. We're just in the middle of an interglaciation. Evidence from deep-sea sediments actually shows that our ice age started when glaciers started growing about 2.5 to 3 million years ago. Both ice sheets and mountain glaciers were forming at this time, but they have some pretty specific requirements. They form above the snow line, or the lowest elevation where there's ice and snow all year round. So where the amount of snow that falls each year is more than the annual ablation, or how much is lost by evaporation and melting. Then, as layers of snow get buried and compacted into ice, the weight of the glacier reshapes and realigns the crystals, making them harder and denser. When the ice is about 30 meters deep, the millions of ice crystals in the bottom layers change form and become plasticky and can glide over each other. Which means that from this depth to its base, the glacier behaves more like Silly Putty and sort of stretches out, carrying the brittle ice on the surface. So a glacier is not just a hard block of ice that slides down a slope. Glaciers usually flow slowly. Large ice sheets move a few centimeters per day and flow out in all directions, while active mountain glaciers can cover several meters each day as they're pulled downhill by gravity. It's really weird to think about, I know. But glaciers don't flow like rivers. They move much slower, but with tremendous energy, meaning they do a ton of work as they engulf and dramatically reshape the landscape, dragging everything in their wake. When a glacier stays more or less the same size, we say it's in dynamic equilibrium, because the amount of new snow is about equal to how much is melting. But when climates warm or there's less snow, glaciers retreat and grow smaller. Ultimately, when there are very few or no glaciers on the planet, we consider the ice age over. We're not quite to that point yet, so we're still technically in an ice age. Remember, I said we're in an interglacial period of this ice age, meaning there are a lot fewer and smaller ice sheets and glaciers on Earth compared to their greatest extent about 20,000 years ago, known as the Last Glacial Maximum. At that time, much of North America, Europe, and southern South America were blanketed in extensive ice sheets and glaciers, which got to be more than 3 kilometers thick in parts of Canada and the US. And when this sheet of frozen water began to melt and retreat quite rapidly some 15,000 years ago, it left behind a ridge that was basically a jumbled heap of gravel, sand, silt, and clay called a terminal moraine. It still stretches more or less continuously across North America from the Puget Sound in Washington state to its southern limits in Midwestern states like Missouri and Nebraska, all the way to Montauk Point on New York's Long Island. The ice sheet even shaped New York City as we know it. Original settlers of the area, the indigenous peoples of Algonquin-speaking languages, utilized features carved by glaciers much in the same way we do now, using the waterways for trade and commerce and ridges as easy paths to walk between villages. In fact, if you've ever walked down Broadway, then you've walked down one of these trade paths. In neighborhoods like Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island, Terminal Moraine forms the high ground. Initially, as the city grew, these sites were ignored for homes and other buildings because they were stony and inaccessible and construction was difficult. Instead, this land became parks, cemeteries, and golf courses. Even today, these remain the more densely wooded and landscaped sections of these neighborhoods, and are now some of the most attractive locations in these boroughs. But back to the ice. Like a giant bulldozer as the glacier moves forward, it drags along everything in its path, picking up tiny pebbles or enormous boulders often the size of a school bus. When it melts, they're left strewn across the landscape as though flung by a giant playing marbles. And Central Park is full of these stray boulders called erratics because, well, they're erratic. They're far from where they would have originated and have different compositions from the surrounding, often younger rocks. Boulders like these were what some of the naturalists were noticing over in Europe. Moraines and erratics are what we call depositional features, which are features formed from the debris carried by ice as glaciers melt, and they still influence how the land is used today, like we saw here in New York City. So glaciers can be like huge excavators hauling debris from one place to another, adding features to the landscape as they melted and retreated. But they also change the land through erosion as they advance. Like the Finger Lakes in central New York. Their distinct, elongated basins were eroded and deepened by ice sheets. And the Great Lakes are actually former river valleys that were greatly enlarged and gouged out by glacial erosion. The bedrock beneath each lake is covered in thick blankets of glacial deposits, which are the bits of rock fragments that the ice picked up as it moved. And as the ice sheet retreated north, meltwater filled in the depressions, forming the Great Lakes. Mountain glaciers have also sculpted majestic landscapes in regions like the Himalayas, Sierra Nevadas, Rockies, Andes, and Alps. Like the Matterhorn on the Swiss-Italian border is the iconic image of the Alps. Its symmetrical spire with precipitous rock walls is a siren call for climbers everywhere, and is the work of glaciers. To start out, we have a mountain glacier, slowly advancing down the mountain slope. As it moves, blocks of rock that have been loosened by weathering get removed or plucked out as part of glacial plucking. Partnered with abrasive rock debris sandpapering the landscape, this forms an armchair-shaped hollow in the side of the mountain called a cirque. When the ice in two adjacent cirques eats away at the ridge between them, it forms a sharp, often serrated ridge called an arete. And when three or more cirques carve away a mountain mass from different sides, we eventually get a horn or pyramidal peak like on the Matterhorn. But the work of the mountain glacier isn't done. As the ice grinds over uneven bedrock and the glacier is stretched as it flows over a convex slope, deep vertical cracks called crevasses open up on the brittle ice on the surface as a response to the stress. Debris that gets left behind can form ridges along the side of the glacier, which we call a lateral moraine. And where two glaciers join, their lateral moraines merge to form a medial moraine. Often moraines dam the foot of a cirque, encasing small, shimmering mountain lakes called tarns, which are among the most popular destinations for backcountry hikers and campers. Further down, a glacier moving through a valley will usually erode the walls and deepen and broaden the valley from a V-shape into a U-shaped profile. These glacial landscapes that have been left behind after the last warming are home to millions of people in Eurasia and North America. They've been plowed to produce crops, dug into for sand and gravel, and paved over by concrete and tarmac. Lately, when we hear about glaciers shaping the Earth, it's because they're breaking. Like in 2021, data from uncrewed submarines showed that warm water may be weakening critical stability points of the Thwaites Glacier, which is also part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and known as the Doomsday Glacier. When it breaks, it could raise global sea levels by over half a meter and potentially collapse the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which would flood lowlands and islands across the world. So the story of ice seems to be closely tied to our human story. Ice has advanced and retreated over time, but when the climate stabilized after the ice started melting 12 to 15,000 years ago, agriculture flourished, and many nomadic groups shifted to more settled lifestyles, setting the scene for many of our societies today. And as the ice melts further, our lives could shift again. So as we contemplate that future, join us next time for a look at the Geography of Natural Hazards. Many maps and borders represent modern geopolitical divisions that have often been decided without the consultation, permission, or recognition of the land's original inhabitants. Many geographical place names also don't reflect the indigenous or aboriginal people's languages. We at Crash Course want to acknowledge these people's traditional and ongoing relationship with that land and all the physical and human geographical elements of it. We encourage you to learn more about the history of the place you call home through resources like NativeLand.ca and by engaging with your local indigenous and aboriginal nations through the websites and resources they provide.

c1938d50-4819-4e06-a3ef-f63c713df3d0,"Hey there, I'm Mike Rugnetta, and this is Crash Course Theater. And this is Yorick. More on him later. So maybe you're a part of your school's theater program. Maybe you're a Broadway musical devotee. Maybe you've just been waiting for a series that would explain things like, what are all of these phalluses doing in Greek drama? And who thought neoclassicism was a good idea? And the Theater of Cruelty? Why so mean? If that's the show that you're after, then great. Have a seat. We've explored several plays in Crash Course literature, mostly Greek tragedies and Shakespearean tragedies. And we'll be looking at plays in Crash Course Theater, but we'll be doing a lot more than that too. We'll explore theater's history, its theories, and even its performance technologies, from the Greeks right into the modern era. Thundersheets, fog machines, rotating gobos. Because reading a play is great, but if you've attended live theater, then you know that it's a different and pretty extraordinary experience to see that play performed right in front of you. We're going to investigate how that experience is produced and what it's meant throughout history to theater-going audiences. Performing, at least when they aren't running off to go see rope dancers or consorting with prostitutes or heading out to grab a beer and a chicken leg, audiences are tricky. But we say it's worth staying in your seat. Why? Because theater is the art form most like life. It's performed by real people, in real space, in real time, and it's often a way to work out our ideas about the social conflicts and problems of the day. Theater is a laboratory for life. It's a place to explore how people feel about government, and religion, and birth, and death, and love, and each other. And sometimes they explore how it's funny to put on a wig and tell lewd jokes. So really, just something for everyone. And oh, just so you know, I won't be teaching you how to act, or direct, or write plays, or hang lights, or sew phalluses onto costumes. Not because I don't love making theater. Actually, I've been making theater since I was a kid. And before YouTube, I was actually a full-time professional theater artist making multimedia performance art in New York. And I still do that stuff occasionally, don't worry, I'll invite you to my one-man show. So it's not like we don't find the nuts and bolts of theater exciting, quite the opposite. But here, we're mostly concerned with theater's history, technology, and its cultural significance on the whole. I'll tell you about Greek tragedy, and Roman comedy, and classical Japanese theater, and how theater returns to the West because of one nun. We'll see cycle plays, and passion plays, and commedia dell'arte, and Shakespeare, obviously, but also Renaissance writers other than Shakespeare. We'll cover really long French plays, and shorter Spanish ones, and classical Indian drama, and melodrama, and symbolism, and Dadaism, and Expressionism, and Futurism, and all the isms. Well, some of the isms. A very reasonable number of isms. And I promise, at least one mention of Hamilton. Until then, exit Mike Rugnetta, and I mean, could we end a theater show any way other"
b06852e1-2413-4e46-962c-ecebd0ea0a2b,"Hi, I'm John Green and welcome to season four of Crash Course Literature. Today we're transporting you to one of my favorite slash least favorite dystopias, George Orwell's 1984. I feel like that eye is looking at me. The book starts like this. It was a bright cold day in April and the clocks were striking 13. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of victory mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him. Of course, it's not just a swirl of gritty dust traveling with Winston. Like everyone in 1984, he's never really alone. In Orwell's dystopian future, 1984, which was published in 1949, the world is vile and gritty and the clock strikes 13 and citizens are under near constant government surveillance. But you know what? Orwell did not correctly predict the future. Our clocks still stop at 12. Also in the novel 1984, people routinely disappear and evidence of their existence is erased from public records and that doesn't happen much...yet. 1984 is an indictment of specific governments, but it's also a warning about the importance of free thought and speech. And in today's episode, we're going to discuss the historical context in which the novel was written and also its use of oppressive language. I want to think about whether Orwell is arguing within the logic of the novel that the written word can significantly alter the society in which it is produced. And I mean that on at least two levels. Can the novel 1984 change the world in which we live? And are characters in that novel ultimately controlled by the language that they and their government use? Spoiler alert, we're all doomed. I'm just kidding. I mean, I hope I'm kidding. The truth is, as usual, complicated. INTRO George Orwell's protagonist, the windblown Winston Smith, shares a first name with Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955. And by replacing a lofty aristocratic surname that evokes, you know, churches and hills with a common one, a Smith is a metal worker, Orwell puts the fate of England in the hands of a working man. Although this one bends words, not metal, since he's a writer. As for whether Orwell's Winston will eventually prevail, as Winston Churchill did in World War II, of course not! Now, some dystopias end with the overthrow of the horrible government, but Orwell's tend to end with the bad guys and or pigs winning. And 1984 is very much a dystopia, a dehumanizing society in which there seemed to be no color in anything and posters of a black mustachioed face gazing down from every commanding corner, bearing the now famous caption, Big Brother is watching you. In this world, the government endorses something called double-think, which links contradictory beliefs. So you see slogans like, War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, and Ignorance is Strength. The problem isn't that citizens are told the opposite of what is true. The real issue is that their experiences have become so limited that they lack the perspective and the language to differentiate between major concepts. But let's back up for a second and talk about George Orwell. Here's some doublespeak for you. George Orwell is not George Orwell. He was born Eric Arthur Blair in 1903 to English parents in Bengal, near the border with Nepal. His father worked in quality control for opium, which is used to make morphine and codeine and heroin, and the British held a monopoly on the trade of opium for many years and exported it to China, both for financial gain and to subdue Chinese citizens. Although the Chinese government tried to get Britain to dismantle the India-China opium trade for 150 years, and there were wars fought about it, China wasn't successful until 1910. Basically, this was like the largest international drug cartel in history, and it was legal. Ah, colonialism. The original dystopia. I guess the original dystopia was actually hunting and gathering. I mean, at least for those of us who hate the paleo diet. God, I love processed carbohydrates. What were we talking about? Oh, right. Eric Arthur Blair, soon to be George Orwell. So as a kid, Blair moved to England and was eventually sent to Eton, a prestigious boarding school, and in 1922 he joined the Imperial Police in Burma. In Why I Write, he explains that he rejected imperialism after spending five years in the, quote, unsuitable profession of working in the Imperial Police Force and experienced poverty himself when he returned to England. Sensitized to the evils of colonialism and now, quote, fully aware of the existence of the working classes, Blair was on his way to forming what he called a political orientation. He changed his name to George Orwell when he published Down and Out in Paris and London in 1933, but he still hadn't identified where he stood politically. Then, in 1936, he declared that he was, quote, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism as I understand it. Democratic socialism basically uses democratic means to create a political and economic structure that supports socialist goals. You know, things like a social safety net and universal health care. You might think of it as being a rejection of unfettered capitalism. Orwell found the, quote, real nature of capitalist society abhorrent because, as he wrote, I have seen British imperialism at work in Burma and I have seen something of the effects of poverty and unemployment in Britain. One has got to be actively a socialist, not merely sympathetic to socialism, or one plays into the hands of our always active enemies. At the same time, Orwell was strongly opposed to Stalin and the totalitarian strains of communism. For instance, in 1936, when he went to Spain to fight the fascist leader Francisco Franco, he joined the Marxist group POUM. He didn't join the main communist party. In homage to Catalonia, he explained, The communists stood not upon the extreme left, but upon the extreme right. In reality, this should come as no surprise because of the tactics of the communist parties elsewhere. These tactics, as seen in the USSR, included the conscious use of propaganda, the repression of individual freedoms, and also state-sponsored murder. But the point I want to make here is that it's not quite accurate for either the contemporary left or right to claim Orwell. His most famous novels are anti-communist, but they're also anti-capitalist. Mostly, they seek to show the ways that many government structures are prone to totalitarianism, and they chart the slow, almost unnoticeable descent into that totalitarianism. But in 1984 specifically, Orwell explores the difficulty of retaining individual freedom within the confines of an oppressive society. In the book, the Earth has been divided into three zones, Oceania, Eurasia, and East Asia, which are constantly at war with one another. And Winston lives in London, the main city of Airstrip One, which is a province of Oceania. He's legally married to the stiff, brainwashed, and desireless Catherine, they're unable to produce children and live separately, but they are forbidden from remarrying. Winston's primary pleasures include itching a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, drinking shots of a, quote, sickly, oily victory gin, which provides the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club, and writing in a, quote, thick, quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover. So, you know, his pleasures are scant. Any life where one of the chief pleasures is scratching an actual physical itch is not, like, a great life. I mean, it's a good life for a dog, but it's not a great life for a person. But then Winston's pleasures, and also his anxieties, experience a significant uptick when he begins an affair with the young, vital, and beautiful Julia. Despite being 10 or 15 years younger, Julia boldly declares her love for Winston. And Winston is a little incredulous. He says, I'm 39 years old. I've got a wife that I can't get rid of. I've got varicose veins. I've got five false teeth. And the reader may have some doubts as well. I mean, when Julia replies, I couldn't care less, Orwell seems to be acknowledging, but not apologizing for, this particular breed of middle-aged male fantasy. But, you know, it's also a romance that serves a plot. So Winston and Julia meet secretly for months. They rent rooms from an antiques dealer named Mr. Charrington in the plebeian quarter of London. They confess their affair and anti-party beliefs to O'Brien, a member of the inner party who seems to be sympathetic to their cause. And they begin reading a book that is allegedly written by the underground resistance leader, Emanuel Goldstein. They know that they'll be discovered and tortured and very probably executed. Their victories, and they do have some, come from tiny moments of consciousness and human connection and personal freedom. And these moments are tiny. For Winston, some of them include procuring a pen with a real nib, quote, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful, creamy paper deserved to be written on. I mean, we're not talking about proper freedom of speech. We're talking about succumbing to the balminess of the April air to stroll through the labyrinth of London. Winston also purchases a glass paperweight containing coral, and all of this leads to a cool point. Despite the authoritarian nature of Ingsoc, the perversion of socialism that dominates Oceania, moments of personal freedom like these are commonplace. There's even a word for them in Newspeak, the new language that the government is developing. Own life, it was called, meaning individualism and eccentricity. But of course, the line between experiencing an own life and engaging in political subversion is really thin. I mean, when Winston gives in to his, quote, animal instinct, the simple, undifferentiated desire to have sex with Julia, their embrace had been a battle, the climax of victory. It was a blow struck against the party. It was a political act. There's no ambiguity there. Making your life yours, making your choices yours is political. And also, having your own thoughts is political. I mean, the party doesn't just suppress subversion through surveillance and arrest and torture and execution, those oldies but goodies from totalitarianism for dummies. In 1984, the government also suppresses individualism by limiting language. Just four pages into the book, an asterisk appears after the first mention of Newspeak. This asterisk interrupts the narrative flow, breaking any bond that the reader may be, or let's be honest, may not be forming with Winston. And it entices the reader toward an appendix, which is narrated by a scholar living long after Winston. And the appendix explains that Newspeak had been devised to meet the ideological needs of Ingsoc, and that its vocabulary had been designed, quote, to make speech and especially speech on any subject not ideologically neutral as nearly as possible independent of consciousness. In other words, Newspeak seeks to make it nearly impossible to express and maybe in turn even to think revolutionary thoughts. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. So Newspeak has three main categories of vocabulary. The A vocabulary contains blunt words for daily functions like eating and working and sleeping. And these words don't have multiple meanings. The examples listed include hit, run, dog, tree, sugar, house, and field. The B vocabulary contains compound words that blend a noun and verb to express a limited number of political or ideological concepts like good think means orthodoxy to party policy, crime think is its opposite. And the C vocabulary is scientific and technical jargon. It contains words accessible only to workers in a particular field with the idea being that no individual will be able to synthesize knowledge from multiple fields. So people will be able to do their work but not understand the context in which that work is happening. And that's one example of how by trying to limit what people can say the government is hoping to constrain what they can think. And an interesting feature of the appendix is that it explains that Winston's version of Newspeak was still, quote, a provisional one and contained many superfluous words and archaic formulations which were due to be suppressed later. This foreshadows that language will become increasingly oppressive which of course is bad news for Winston and his peers but there is some good news for the rest of humanity. Because you will notice that the appendix is written in standard English and as many readers including Thomas Pynchon and Margaret Atwood have pointed out, this suggests that free thought and its expression will ultimately prevail and that language will someday again be rich and complex and free. Thanks Thought Bubble. So how do we get back to free language? While I'm a writer and as such I'm almost professionally obligated to believe in the power of language, next week we'll go into more detail about the complicated relationship between thoughts and language but I think it's worth mentioning now that while we don't think entirely in words language does help give form and expression to complex ideas within us. I mean that's part of what books attempt to do but it's also something we're all doing all day because we think in language. It's one of the primary ways we communicate our feelings and experiences to other people but it's also one of the primary ways we communicate that stuff within us. And I think in 1984 Orwell argues that the restriction of language is ultimately a form of restricting thought itself. It's encouraging that newspeak may ultimately fail but it does make me wonder what thoughts can't I think because of the language that I've inherited? Next time we'll also address a question that should be on your mind since you're watching this video on something very like a telescreen possibly while in a government-funded school where the government is deciding at least in part what you learn about. What can 1984 teach us about our current political context and our relationship to what many have called surveillance society? And in a world where so many of us volunteer so much of ourselves to the public sphere is there value in a private life? Spoiler alert! I think there is but we'll talk more about that next week.

2f4bb25b-eb34-4c9e-946a-5d2125429593,"INTRO Hey there, I'm Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash Course Theater, and today is going to be a tragedy. A Greek tragedy, which is a lot like a regular tragedy, only older and with more stuffed grape leaves. We'll be exploring Aristotle's theories on this art form, written more than a century after the golden age of Athenian drama. Then we'll apply them retrospectively to the only surviving tragic trilogy we have, the Orestia of Aeschylus. Ready for some husband-killing, some mother-killing, and, maybe unsurprisingly, the invention of the jury trial. INTRO INTRO INTRO INTRO INTRO Meet Aristotle. Just Aristotle. No last name. Like Cher. But older. Also believes in life after love, though. He was born in 384 BCE and lived in Greece and Macedonia. He spent many years studying with Plato, a philosopher who wasn't a big fan of drama or poetry. Plato wrote that poets encourage a false vision of reality and should be excluded from the ideal state. Ugh. Harsh, dude. Luckily for us, his pupil Aristotle was a little more open-minded. In 335 BCE, a little while after he'd finished tutoring Alexander the Great, Aristotle sat down to write The Poetics, the first substantial work of literary criticism. Originally, The Poetics was in two parts, a section on tragedy and a section on comedy. But only the tragedy part survives. Aristotle was writing 200 years after Citi Dainesia really got going, and 150 years after the beginning of the Golden Age of Greek drama. So The Poetics isn't really about analyzing contemporary work. It's about looking at the work that came before Aristotle, deciding what's great about it, and providing a handbook for future playwrights and audiences. Aristotle was basically trying to stick it to Plato by proving that poetry and theater could be useful to society. He was a big fan of Sophocles, and the rules Aristotle set out apply most closely to Sophocles's own Oedipus Rex, which you might remember from Crash Course Literature. Club foot, murder, incest, stabbing out the eyes. It's memorable stuff. But Aristotle's theories apply in many ways to all of the works of Greek tragedy. And often, we can gain a lot of insight through how ancient plays do or do not tick the boxes that Aristotle set up. And in fact, Aristotle's theories continue to influence how we write and think about modern plays. First off, the tragedy portion of Aristotle's Poetics considers several forms of poetry, including the tragedy and the epic, which is different in that it's mostly descriptive rather than imitative. It tells rather than shows, like the dithy-roms we discussed last episode. But we're here to talk tragedy, which Aristotle defines as proper purgation of these emotions. So okay, a lot of this language is ambiguous, but there are some conclusions we can draw. We're going to go bit by bit. What does serious mean? Well, there probably aren't a lot of satyrs or phalluses. Complete, each play in a tragedy has to stand independent from other works in its trilogy. That's lucky for us, because as we discussed last time, invading hordes have a bad habit of burning libraries, and we've lost a lot of plays. Of a certain magnitude, that's trickier. But if you read Greek tragedies, you'll notice they deal with legendary heroes or royal families—characters whose lives will have a sizable impact. Also, their difficulties are not minor. These are stories about murder, vengeance, betrayal—again, memorable stuff. By language embellished, Aristotle means not only poetry, but also song. In the form of action, not narrative, means showing rather than telling, and through pity and fear affecting the proper purgation of those emotions, that's catharsis. And as we suggested last episode, it's kept scholars fearful and piteous for centuries. We offered one explanation last time, that plays help make people better citizens by purging them of emotions unhelpful to the city-state. You have a good cry at the theater so that you're not crying when it comes to making political decisions. But scholars have argued that this catharsis is actually supposed to happen for the characters on stage. There's been a lot of debate about whether the goal of catharsis is an emotional purgation or an intellectual clarification. Is catharsis supposed to awaken your emotions or trigger some deeply rational thoughts? Shockingly, experts disagree. Aristotle also said tragedy is composed of six parts—plot, character, diction, thought, spectacle, and song. They're important pretty much in that order, although he does say that song matters more than spectacle. So take that, projection designers. Wait a minute. I've designed projections. You don't want too much spectacle, he says, because that's cheap. And tragedy should be enjoyable, but not, like, too enjoyable. And Aristotle argues that even though it's characters we care about, it's actually the plot—the tragic action—that's most important. You could have a character just like Oedipus, for instance, who doesn't kill his father or marry his mother, but, well, that's not really much of a tragedy. Aristotle believes that in order for a tragedy to really work, it needs to focus on a mostly good character who, through the tragic action, is then brought low. If you have a mostly bad character brought low, big whoop, they had it coming, no tragedy. Same goes for a mostly good character who stays good. No pity, no fear, no catharsis. An unimpeachably good character brought low doesn't work either, because the tragic action has to be their fault, at least a little. Aristotle writes that the ideal is to have a mostly noble and illustrious character whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error or frailty. The word for frailty in Greek is hamartia. It's a term that comes from archery, and it means missing the mark. A tragic character doesn't have some horrible inborn flaw, but more like tries to do a good job and whiffs it. Aristotle thought that a tragic plot needed to have three main elements—reversal, recognition, and a scene of suffering. The Greek word for reversal is peripatia. You might recognize it from the English word peripatetic, which means walking back and forth. Reversal means just when you think something's going okay, there's a change, usually signaled by the arrival of a messenger, and then everything just gets terrible again. Someone has got to start shooting those messengers. It's the only way to solve this problem. Recognition, known as anagnorisis, is what happens when a character finally recognizes something. That was my mother! That was my son! I shouldn't have eaten that second piece of cake! Recognition combined with a reversal is best, Aristotle says. It automatically produces pity or fear, maybe even both. Finally, after recognition comes the scene of suffering—exile, suicide, huge psychological trauma. It's fun stuff. And just the kind of thing that a healthy city-state would want to sponsor for the good of its people. To get a feel for some of these elements, let's take a quick look at the Oresteia, the only surviving Greek tragic trilogy, which won first prize in 458 BCE. It retells a mythical story, one covered at least in part in The Odyssey. Its three plays are Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides. We'll look at the first two in the Thought Bubble. In the first play, the general Agamemnon returns to Argos from the Trojan War. His wife, Clytemnestra, only pretends to greet him happily. Why is she mad? Because he sacrificed their daughter to make some winds blow, that's why. To make matters worse, Agamemnon has also brought home his concubine, Cassandra. Clytemnestra's lover, Aegisthus, is also ticked. Because, get ready, his father, once king, raped his daughter because an oracle said an incest son would get revenge on his uncle, who tricked his father into eating his now-deceased half-siblings. His sister-mom, ashamed, disowns him, so he's gotta work his way from goat farmer back up to royalty. Which he does, but then is ousted by Menelaus, who installs Agamemnon as king. So long story medium short, Clytemnestra convinces Agamemnon to walk on some tapestries, which is a sacrilegious act, a sign that he is prideful, which he sorta is, thus by ancient tradition justifying his murder. In some versions, Aegisthus kills Agamemnon, in others it's Clytemnestra, but either way, he gets it in the bath, no less. In the second play, things go bad in Argos. Electra, the daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, is miserable. Orestes, her brother, arrives in disguise, and together they plot to murder their mother. Which is usually frowned upon, but the chorus is all Right. On. So, giving in to their worst impulses, they kill Clytemnestra and Aegisthus. Just when it seems like things might get back to normal, the Furies, aka the Aranys, arrive. The Furies are scary, snake-haired women who terrorize you when you've spilled family blood. They chase Orestes out of the palace. Thanks Thought Bubble, but the tragedy, of course, does not stop there. In the third play, Orestes seeks shelter with the god Apollo, and then heads to Athens. He appeals to the goddess Athena, and she arranges a trial for him, drafting twelve citizens for the jury. Orestes and the Furies present their cases, and the jury deadlocks, and Athena acts as the tiebreaker. The case comes down to whether it's worse to kill a mother or a husband. Apollo argues that mothers aren't really parents, they're just hosts for the father's seed. I'm sorry. What? And then Athena is like, well, I was born from my father's forehead, so I can totally get behind that. Orestes, you're free, Furies, I'm rebranding you the Eumenides, the kindly ones, and making you patron goddesses of marriage and children. Libations all around! So that is how we get the jury trial. And some messed up ideas about parentage. As you may have noticed, each of these three plays don't tick every Aristotle box. The third play has a non-tragic ending. But we can see how the engines of Aristotelian tragedy drive these works. In each play, the action is more important than the characters, who can seem somewhat flat and unconvincing. Clytemnestra offers about six different motivations for her dastardly deeds, including that she finds murder sexually arousing, which is troubling. But in every play, there is plenty of action. In the first two plays, we can see mostly noble characters missing the mark. Agamemnon agrees to walk on some tapestries, Orestes decides to resort to violence. There's suffering aplenty. Taking the three plays as a whole, they show that the only thing to break the tragic cycle of blood, guilt, and vengeance is literal divine intervention. Divine intervention and jury duty, which is a pretty convincing way to remind the audience of the importance of the city's democratic institutions. Do these plays offer catharsis? Well, it's going to depend on how we interpret catharsis. And of course, it's also going to depend on how these plays are performed. But in a strong production, I would say chances are good that you feel pity. Or fear. Or both. So enjoy your purgation, and then go vote with a clear head. We'll see you next time for Greek comedy. Yep, all the phalluses. And on that note, curtain. Crash Course Theater is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios.

4c09c34c-e4f4-4bbe-a930-824c0c7d3699,"Hey there, I'm Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash Course Theater, and today we're traveling to Ancient Greece to uncover the origins of Western drama. Right Dionysus? He's… he's still hungover. My dude, this is your episode! You gotta get up! If we believe the ritualism theory from last episode, then eons of religious or quasi-religious rituals eventually birthed drama. But how? Well, it has to do a bunch with our grape-loving friend over here. By the 6th century BCE, Dionysus had become a very popular god in Greece, especially among the ladies. According to some maybe-true-maybe-not reports, women participated in a ritual where they'd run through the countryside, tear apart some animals, and then come home. It's fun, right? And if you want to know more about it, you can check out the Bacchae by Euripides. It is great. Whether or not that happened, we do have good evidence that in the 6th century BCE, some less-wild rituals celebrating Dionysus spread through Greece. One of the most popular involved a procession from Eleutheria to Athens, where worshippers lofted a giant phallus and sang songs, called dithyroms, in praise of you-know-who. And one theory about those dithyroms, actually, is that eventually they evolved into theater, when singers started acting out the action instead of just singing it. Aristotle and his followers think that sooner or later, a singer stepped out of the dithyrom chorus and started acting out individual characters. This actor was called Thespis. Like actually, that was his name, and that's where we get the noun thespian. According to stories, Thespis learned to switch between characters, and to enhance the effect, he got the bright idea to use masks. This was Greek tragedy in its earliest form. One actor paired with a chorus. It still sounded a lot like a dithyrom, or like a bard reciting portions of epics as banquet entertainment, but the direct impersonation of a song's characters made it different. And it continued to develop, adding actors and architectural elements for about 150 years. Tragedy, by the way, derives from the Greek words for goat and song, which may have had to do with animal sacrifices that were made during the festivals, or it may just be another reference to satyrs. Theater eventually gets institutionalized in Athens. Late in the 6th century BCE, pre-democracy Athens was ruled by a tyrant named Pesistratus. Pesistratus came to power through violence, but once he was in charge, he wanted to unite and strengthen the city. He decided that festivals, particularly those in praise of Dionysus, would be a good way to get everyone on board. Because why not? So, in the 530s BCE, he expanded one of the god's pre-existing spring festivals and turned Athens into city Dionysia, with a theater competition at its center. Now, this festival wasn't only about theater. It was also about reaffirming Athens as a source of pride and power. It lasted five or six days and included a lot of events. Military and political leaders poured out libations. Tribute from cities of the Athenian Empire was displayed on stage. Names of men who greatly benefited Athens were read out. Children of soldiers who had died in war and had now reached maturity were brought on stage. There were also dithyrom contests. The theater competition took place in an outdoor amphitheater in front of a crowd of about 14,000 spectators. That likely included the whole range of Athenian society, even women and slaves. But of course, only male citizens could perform in the chorus or vote for best play. The contest was between three different playwrights. Each had to submit a tetralogy, a four-part work. The first three parts were linked tragedies, and the fourth part was a sadder play, which was lewd and usually involved a lot of prop penises. In 486 BCE, a comedy competition was added. Once competing playwrights were chosen, they were matched with a prominent Athenian citizen who would bankroll the production. Our big spender was called the kouragas, and it was his job to assemble the chorus, hire the flute player, and buy the masks or any other set furniture like a bed or a throne. The playwright usually did the jobs that we now associate with director, composer, and set designer. Sometimes they even acted in their own work alongside other performers. There may have been up to three actors on stage, and then the chorus. Unfortunately, none of the music from these shows remains, but there are some painted vases that suggest what productions may have looked like. Fun fact, the chorus would sometimes dance. I wonder how hard it is to high kick in a toga. For a look at the theater structure itself, let's go to the Thought Level. The Theater of Dionysus was an outdoor amphitheater built into the Athenian hillside. You can still visit the ruins today. Its first incarnation might not have had seats, but eventually they were added, wood first and then stone. The seated section was known as the theatron, or seeing place. The chorus performed on a flat part called the orchestra, and in the center of the orchestra was the thimele, or altar. At some point, a dressing hut called a skeeney was also built, so that actors could change masks. With only two or three actors playing every role, you gotta change masks pretty often. There were several ways on and off stage, known as paradoi, including two side entrances so big choruses could march on and off when needed. There was also a place on top of the skeeney where an actor playing a god could appear and descend in a cart, which was called the god in the machine, or the deus ex machina. Maybe you're wondering, why might a playwright need a god to descend from the heavens? Well, sometimes you write your way into a situation and you can't write yourself out. So it's pretty helpful to have Zeus or Apollo come on down and make everything right. All of the actors wore masks made of linen, with hair attached, so they probably looked pretty frightening. Especially the one of Oedipus, with blood all around the eyes. Tragic actors also wore robes and platform shoes called catherni, so just imagine a lot of big, sweeping gestures and trying not to trip. Thanks, Thought Bubble. Ugh, that thing is no less terrifying from the inside, either. So during the Dithy Realm contest, after each playwright presented his tetralogy, a group of ten randomly chosen citizens would select the winner, who was honored with an ivy wreath, sacrificial animals, and a big banquet. The Athenians took this contest very seriously, and if any funny business was suspected, there were lawsuits. Tragedy hit its golden age in 5th century Athens, first with the works of Aeschylus, then Sophocles and Euripides. Because papyrus disintegrates and invading hordes kept burning libraries, we don't have the plays that they wrote. Aeschylus wrote as many as 90 plays, but we have only 7. Sophocles wrote 120, but we have only 7. Of the 92 Euripides wrote, more than 7 at least this time. We have 19. Those 30-odd plays have had a huge impact, though. They're still very widely read. They matter to us now because they provide a template for most contemporary drama. But let's look for a second at how they mattered then. It's a huge deal to have 14,000 of your most prominent citizens hang out on a hillside watching plays when they could be doing their civic duty. But as it turns out, they were doing their civic duty. The leading citizens of Athens decided that it was important to get together and see plays that actively question the values and structures of the state. These plays are exploring what it means to be a part of a family and a nation, and what to do when divided loyalties create conflict. They can teach you to be a better person and a better citizen by encouraging you to ask, through the dramatic action, what a good person is, and what a good citizen does. Tragedy does something else, too, at least according to Aristotle. He wrote the Poetics, one of the world's first works of literary criticism. And he had a theory about what made tragedy so important, and his theory was about catharsis, which literally means purgation. Aristotle writes that tragedy, through pity and fear, affects the proper purgation of these emotions. Now, a lot of scholars have spilled a lot of ink trying to explain what this means, so it's unlikely we are going to get to the bottom of it right here and now. But let me quickly offer one interpretation of catharsis. Let's try out the idea that tragedy, by exciting the emotions of pity and fear, becomes an outlet for those emotions. If we believe that pity and fear maybe aren't that helpful in a democracy, then we can argue that it's better to feel these things at a play. Have an emotional catharsis and then just get that stuff out of our systems and go back to being productive members of society. Like, imagine how productive all those people who've seen Les Mis hundreds of times must be. Or people who've seen thousands of episodes of General Hospital, for that matter. Next time, we're going to look more closely at Aristotle's theories, and use them to discuss Aeschylus' Oresteia, the only complete tragic trilogy we have. And then, finally, on to the satyrs and their phalluses. Thanks for watching, and curtain. Crash Course Theater is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios.

f0aa35b5-a4ce-4450-bdfe-4602aaaf40d0,"Hi, I'm John Green and welcome to season four of Crash Course Literature. Today we're transporting you to one of my favorite slash least favorite dystopias, George Orwell's 1984. I feel like that eye is looking at me. The book starts like this. It was a bright cold day in April and the clocks were striking 13. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of victory mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him. Of course, it's not just a swirl of gritty dust traveling with Winston. Like everyone in 1984, he's never really alone. In Orwell's dystopian future, 1984, which was published in 1949, the world is vile and gritty and the clock strikes 13 and citizens are under near constant government surveillance. But you know what? Orwell did not correctly predict the future. Our clocks still stop at 12. Also in the novel 1984, people routinely disappear and evidence of their existence is erased from public records and that doesn't happen much...yet. 1984 is an indictment of specific governments, but it's also a warning about the importance of free thought and speech. And in today's episode, we're going to discuss the historical context in which the novel was written and also its use of oppressive language. I want to think about whether Orwell is arguing within the logic of the novel that the written word can significantly alter the society in which it is produced. And I mean that on at least two levels. Can the novel 1984 change the world in which we live? And are characters in that novel ultimately controlled by the language that they and their government use? Spoiler alert, we're all doomed. I'm just kidding. I mean, I hope I'm kidding. The truth is, as usual, complicated. INTRO George Orwell's protagonist, the windblown Winston Smith, shares a first name with Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955. And by replacing a lofty aristocratic surname that evokes, you know, churches and hills with a common one, a Smith is a metal worker, Orwell puts the fate of England in the hands of a working man. Although this one bends words, not metal, since he's a writer. As for whether Orwell's Winston will eventually prevail, as Winston Churchill did in World War II, of course not! Now, some dystopias end with the overthrow of the horrible government, but Orwell's tend to end with the bad guys and or pigs winning. And 1984 is very much a dystopia, a dehumanizing society in which there seemed to be no color in anything and posters of a black mustachioed face gazing down from every commanding corner bearing the now famous caption, Big Brother is watching you. In this world, the government endorses something called double-think, which links contradictory beliefs. So you see slogans like, War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, and Ignorance is Strength. The problem isn't that citizens are told the opposite of what is true. The real issue is that their experiences have become so limited that they lack the perspective and the language to differentiate between major concepts. But let's back up for a second and talk about George Orwell. Here's some doublespeak for you. George Orwell is not George Orwell. He was born Eric Arthur Blair in 1903 to English parents in Bengal, near the border with Nepal. His father worked in quality control for opium, which is used to make morphine and codeine and heroin, and the British held a monopoly on the trade of opium for many years and exported it to China, both for financial gain and to subdue Chinese citizens. Although the Chinese government tried to get Britain to dismantle the India-China opium trade for 150 years, and there were wars fought about it, China wasn't successful until 1910. Basically, this was like the largest international drug cartel in history, and it was legal. Ah, colonialism. The original dystopia. I guess the original dystopia was actually hunting and gathering. I mean, at least for those of us who hate the paleo diet. God, I love processed carbohydrates. What were we talking about? Oh, right. Eric Arthur Blair, soon to be George Orwell. So as a kid, Blair moved to England and was eventually sent to Eton, a prestigious boarding school, and in 1922 he joined the Imperial Police in Burma. In Why I Write, he explains that he rejected imperialism after spending five years in the, quote, unsuitable profession of working in the Imperial Police Force and experienced poverty himself when he returned to England. Sensitized to the evils of colonialism and now, quote, fully aware of the existence of the working classes, Blair was on his way to forming what he called a political orientation. He changed his name to George Orwell when he published Down and Out in Paris and London in 1933, but he still hadn't identified where he stood politically. Then, in 1936, he declared that he was, quote, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism as I understand it. Democratic socialism basically uses democratic means to create a political and economic structure that supports socialist goals. You know, things like a social safety net and universal health care. You might think of it as being a rejection of unfettered capitalism. Orwell found the, quote, real nature of capitalist society abhorrent because, as he wrote, I have seen British imperialism at work in Burma and I have seen something of the effects of poverty and unemployment in Britain. One has got to be actively a socialist, not merely sympathetic to socialism, or one plays into the hands of our always active enemies. At the same time, Orwell was strongly opposed to Stalin and the totalitarian strains of communism. For instance, in 1936, when he went to Spain to fight the fascist leader Francisco Franco, he joined the Marxist group POUM. He didn't join the main communist party. In homage to Catalonia, he explained, The communists stood not upon the extreme left, but upon the extreme right. In reality, this should come as no surprise because of the tactics of the communist parties elsewhere. These tactics, as seen in the USSR, included the conscious use of propaganda, the repression of individual freedoms, and also state-sponsored murder. But the point I want to make here is that it's not quite accurate for either the contemporary left or right to claim Orwell. His most famous novels are anti-communist, but they're also anti-capitalist. Mostly, they seek to show the ways that many government structures are prone to totalitarianism, and they chart the slow, almost unnoticeable descent into that totalitarianism. But in 1984 specifically, Orwell explores the difficulty of retaining individual freedom within the confines of an oppressive society. In the book, the Earth has been divided into three zones, Oceania, Eurasia, and East Asia, which are constantly at war with one another. And Winston lives in London, the main city of Airstrip One, which is a province of Oceania. He's legally married to the stiff, brainwashed, and desireless Catherine, they're unable to produce children and live separately, but they are forbidden from remarrying. Winston's primary pleasures include itching a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, drinking shots of a, quote, sickly, oily victory gin, which provides the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club, and writing in a, quote, thick, quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover. So, you know, his pleasures are scant. Any life where one of the chief pleasures is scratching an actual physical itch is not, like, a great life. I mean, it's a good life for a dog, but it's not a great life for a person. But then Winston's pleasures, and also his anxieties, experience a significant uptick when he begins an affair with the young, vital, and beautiful Julia. Despite being 10 or 15 years younger, Julia boldly declares her love for Winston, and Winston is a little incredulous. He says, I'm 39 years old, I've got a wife that I can't get rid of, I've got varicose veins, I've got five false teeth. And the reader may have some doubts as well. I mean, when Julia replies, I couldn't care less, Orwell seems to be acknowledging, but not apologizing, for this particular breed of middle-aged male fantasy. But, you know, it's also a romance that serves a plot. So Winston and Julia meet secretly for months. They rent rooms from an antiques dealer named Mr. Charrington in the plebeian quarter of London. They confess their affair and anti-party beliefs to O'Brien, a member of the inner party who seems to be sympathetic to their cause. And they begin reading a book that is allegedly written by the underground resistance leader Emanuel Goldstein. They know that they'll be discovered and tortured and very probably executed. Their victories, and they do have some, come from tiny moments of consciousness and human connection and personal freedom. And these moments are tiny. For Winston, some of them include procuring a pen with a real nib, quote, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful, creamy paper deserved to be written on. I mean, we're not talking about proper freedom of speech. We're talking about succumbing to the balminess of the April air to stroll through the labyrinth of London. Winston also purchases a glass paperweight containing coral. And all of this leads to a cool point. Despite the authoritarian nature of Ingsoc, the perversion of socialism that dominates Oceania, moments of personal freedom like these are commonplace. There's even a word for them in Newspeak, the new language that the government is developing. Own life, it was called, meaning individualism and eccentricity. But of course, the line between experiencing an own life and engaging in political subversion is really thin. I mean, when Winston gives in to his, quote, animal instinct, the simple, undifferentiated desire to have sex with Julia, their embrace had been a battle, the climax of victory. It was a blow struck against the party. It was a political act. There's no ambiguity there. Making your life yours, making your choices yours, is political. And also, having your own thoughts is political. I mean, the party doesn't just suppress subversion through surveillance and arrest and torture and execution, those oldies but goodies from totalitarianism for dummies. In 1984, the government also suppresses individualism by limiting language. Just four pages into the book, an asterisk appears after the first mention of Newspeak. This asterisk interrupts the narrative flow, breaking any bond that the reader may be, or let's be honest, may not be forming with Winston. And it entices the reader toward an appendix, which is narrated by a scholar living long after Winston. And the appendix explains that Newspeak had been devised to meet the ideological needs of Ingsoc, and that its vocabulary had been designed, quote, to make speech, and especially speech on any subject not ideologically neutral, as nearly as possible independent of consciousness. In other words, Newspeak seeks to make it nearly impossible to express, and maybe in turn even to think, revolutionary thoughts. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. So Newspeak has three main categories of vocabulary. The A vocabulary contains blunt words for daily functions, like eating and working and sleeping. And these words don't have multiple meanings. The examples listed include hit, run, dog, tree, sugar, house, and field. The B vocabulary contains compound words that blend a noun and verb to express a limited number of political or ideological concepts, like good think means orthodoxy to party policy, crime think is its opposite. And the C vocabulary is scientific and technical jargon. It contains words accessible only to workers in a particular field, with the idea being that no individual will be able to synthesize knowledge from multiple fields. So people will be able to do their work, but not understand the context in which that work is happening. And that's one example of how by trying to limit what people can say, the government is hoping to constrain what they can think. And an interesting feature of the appendix is that it explains that Winston's version of Newspeak was still, quote, a provisional one and contained many superfluous words and archaic formulations which were due to be suppressed later. This foreshadows that language will become increasingly oppressive, which of course is bad news for Winston and his peers, but there is some good news for the rest of humanity. Because you will notice that the appendix is written in standard English, and as many readers, including Thomas Pynchon and Margaret Atwood, have pointed out, this suggests that free thought and its expression will ultimately prevail, and that language will someday again be rich and complex and free. Thanks, Thought Bubble. So how do we get back to free language? While I'm a writer, and as such I'm almost professionally obligated to believe in the power of language, next week we'll go into more detail about the complicated relationship between thoughts and language. But I think it's worth mentioning now that while we don't think entirely in words, language does help give form and expression to complex ideas within us. I mean, that's part of what books attempt to do, but it's also something we're all doing all day because we think in language. It's one of the primary ways we communicate our feelings and experiences to other people, but it's also one of the primary ways we communicate that stuff within us. And I think in 1984, Orwell argues that the restriction of language is ultimately a form of restricting thought itself. It's encouraging that Newspeak may ultimately fail, but it does make me wonder, what thoughts can't I think because of the language that I've inherited? Next time, we'll also address a question that should be on your mind since you're watching this video on something very like a telescreen, possibly while in a government-funded school where the government is deciding, at least in part, what you learn about. What can 1984 teach us about our current political context and our relationship to what many have called surveillance society? And in a world where so many of us volunteer so much of ourselves to the public sphere, is there value in a private life? Spoiler alert! I think there is, but we'll talk more about that next week.

203d4684-a60a-4dfd-8210-a1ddb3739f6c,"Hi, I'm Clint Smith, and this is Crash Course Black American History. And today, we're talking about Black women's experiences in the early days of American slavery. Enslavement, as has been made obvious by now, was inherently cruel to anyone subjected to it. But it's important for us to note the unique ways that men and women experience the institution in different ways because of their sex. Women's experiences under slavery gave them specific vantage points from which to observe what was happening around them, and also left them particularly vulnerable to some of the most horrific parts of the institution. So we want to spend a little bit of time talking about the experiences unique to enslaved women directly. INTRO I want to note up front that there will be some mentions of sexual violence in this episode. Upon arrival at American ports, African captives were taken from various trading hubs to be auctioned off to the highest bidder for plantation labor. Historian Dinah Ramey Berry writes in her book, The Price for Their Pound of Flesh, that an enslaved person could be worth anywhere from $4 to $94,000, when adjusted for 2014 numbers. Plantation owners searched for enslaved laborers to cultivate cash crops, the most lucrative of which being cotton, sugar, indigo, tobacco, and rice. So when these enslavers came to markets searching for new laborers, they considered several factors before making a bid. Enslavers considered the health and strength of potential laborers, age, height, skin color, and the specific skills an enslaved worker might have been able to bring. But there was another element that shaped the hierarchy of value to prospective enslavers, and that's gender. Gender placed a figurative price ceiling on enslaved women's value, even though, as we'll see, they were often expected to do the exact same labor as enslaved men. The deeply entrenched patriarchy in European cultures extended across racial lines and played a significant role in shaping African captives' monetary worth. And even though enslaved women were not sold at the same high price range as enslaved men, their value to those who purchased them was absolutely clear. In many regions of the colonies, enslaved women's ability to reproduce was hugely important. Buying a laborer who could bear children meant that once those children got older, the enslaver could either exploit that child's labor or sell that child for a profit. And as we've discussed, one of the most consequential laws that developed around slavery in the colonial era was Virginia's use of Partis Sequitur Ventrum, codified by the Virginia Assembly in 1662, which established the legal precedent that defined an enslaved person by their mother's status, not their father's. Therefore, regardless of the father's race, an enslaved Black woman's child would automatically be classified as the property of her enslaver, meaning that children had from an enslaved woman and a white man who may have even enslaved her would be born into slavery and owned by their father. In their jobs on plantations, enslaved women sometimes did domestic labor, which consisted primarily of cooking, cleaning, waiting on the lady of the house, and caring for the children of the estate. New and nursing Black mothers would often be forced to prioritize the care of the white children of the estate, even at the expense of their own children. It was not uncommon for enslaved women to breastfeed white infants, as it was a task that white women on the plantations sometimes preferred not to do. But while there were many Black women who engaged in domestic labor, in most cases, enslavers directed women to work outside the home, working the land alongside the men and even their children. While women's labor in the field was comparable to men's, they weren't always allowed to take on some artisanal positions, like carpentry. Chattel slavery disrupted traditional gender norms within the colonies and in the emerging United States in profound ways. Black women were seen in fundamentally different ways than white women, and many of the typical notions around gender roles simply did not apply to them. Sojourner Truth became one of the earliest and foremost speakers to address Black women's unique experiences in a racist and sexist society. Spending a little bit of time with her can be illuminating because she directly experienced and spoke about life as a Black woman in bondage. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. Sojourner Truth was born Isabella Bonfrey, aka Belle, in 1797 in upstate New York. She was purchased and sold four times and was made to do brutal physical labor. Truth, as we've mentioned of other enslaved women before, also attested to having to nurse white babies in place of her own as part of her expected chores. She also had to tend to poultry, prepare the ground for the cultivation of corn, pumpkins, and buckwheat, and even cut the grass, which at that time wasn't as simple as just hopping on a tractor or pushing a lawnmower. It involved a scythe and a lot of upper body strength. It was grueling work. In fact, when her enslaver John Dumont offered the possibility of freeing her, she attempted to increase her work product as a show of goodwill. In the process, though, she lost her index finger during a work accident, which in a situation filled with cruel irony, led Dumont not to keep his promise, claiming that she'd become less productive because of the accident. After realizing that Dumont wouldn't free her, Truth decided that she was going to free herself. So she decided to just walk away. She gathered her still-nursing child, said her goodbyes to the rest of her family, and left before dawn, eventually reaching a local abolitionist family, the Van Wagenens, who paid Dumont $20 to buy Truth's labor for the remainder of the year. She remained with the family until she was freed when the New York State Emancipation Act went into effect. She later successfully sued for the return of her six-year-old son Peter, who was illegally sold into slavery in Alabama. Thanks Thought Bubble. You may have heard of Sojourner Truth because of her famous Ain't I a Woman speech. The one where she said, I've borne thirteen children and seen most all sold off to slavery. And when I cried out with my mother's grief, none but Jesus heard me. And ain't I a woman? Well, it turns out that she might not have actually said it in that exact way. Truth gave a speech in 1851, that's for sure, but as historian Nell Painter explains in her book Sojourner, A Life, A Symbol, while this is the version that is most widely circulated, it's not one that's really grounded in, well, truth. This famous but inaccurate version was written and published 12 years later in 1863 by a white abolitionist named Frances Dana Barker Gage. Not only did Gage change or simply make up some of Sojourner's words, but she also put the speech in a stereotypical Southern Black slave accent, rather than in Truth's actual Upper New York State Low Dutch accent, which sounded very different. And what's more, the line Gage originally published was Ain't I a Woman, but became widely recast as the Ain't I a Woman speech in the early 20th century. It's a reminder of how throughout slavery, the testimonies of Black people were often filtered through others, who may or may not have made their own changes along the way. One of the most horrifying parts of Black women's experience in slavery was the pervasive sexual violence and harassment that they were subjected to. Harriet Jacobs provides a detailed account of the sexual violence that shaped the everyday lives of Black women in her 1861 autobiography, Incidents of the Life of a Slave Girl, which she originally published under the pseudonym Linda Brent in order to protect herself. She writes, My master met me at every turn, reminding me that I belonged to him, and swearing by heaven and earth that he would compel me to submit to him. If I went out for a breath of fresh air after a day of unweary toil, his footsteps dogged me. If I knelt by my mother's grave, his dark shadow fell on me even there. The light heart which nature had given me became heavy with sad forebodings. The sexual violence that Black women experienced took on many different forms. There was even a practice called the fancy trade, designed specifically for the sale of mixed-race women for sexual concubinage and prostitution. In 1937, a formerly enslaved man, W. L. Bost, explains some of these dynamics to an interviewer for the Federal Writers Project, a New Deal-era initiative which recorded the oral testimonies of over 2,300 formerly enslaved people in the late 1930s. As we mentioned before, Black testimonies were often filtered through white perspectives. So when published, these conversations in the Federal Writers Project were often written with a heavy dialect attributed to the Black interviewees. Bost is reported as having said, Plenty of the colored women have children by the white men. She know better than to not do what he say. They take them very same children, would have their own blood, and make slaves out of them. While the use of sexual agency is discussed by many historians and writers as a viable form of resistance, it's important that we not misconstrue it for consent. The writer and scholar Saidiya Hartman urges us to redefine rape and sexual assault within the context of slavery. Women who were legally defined as property were never in a position to provide consent when in so many ways, their bodies and their choices did not belong to them in the first place. With that in mind, relationships with an enslaver, to the extent that any such association can be called a relationship given the power dynamics in place, could provide some women certain types of protection and some small privileges that other enslaved people did not receive. That could take on many forms. It could mean not having to work in the field. It could mean having slightly better food for one's family. It could also mean keeping one's children safe from harm or from being sold away. Black women were presented with a series of impossible choices, and each one decided for themselves how to navigate it. Slavery was an all-encompassing, oppressive institution, and enslaved life and labor were difficult regardless of someone's sex, but it did not affect black men and black women in the same ways, and it's important that we be precise about that. Their experiences reveal that as critical as black women's labor and reproduction were to the early American economies, they were not valued as such, not on the auction block, and certainly not in respect to their womanhood. Black women's particular experiences during the era of slavery give us insight into the early iterations of racialized and gendered oppression that would continue to evolve in new and insidious ways for centuries to come.

74a16b75-0137-4618-904d-f25de351b212,"Hi, I'm Clint Smith, and this is Crash Course Black American History. When you think of U.S. citizenship, you might think of your blue passport, or placing your hand over your heart and saying the Pledge of Allegiance, or waving an American flag as you watch fireworks during the Fourth of July with a plate full of barbecue. Citizenship is something that matters to people. Not only is citizenship a source of pride for many, but it has vast implications for how someone can live their life. It can determine where you work, where you can travel, whether or not you can vote, and even if you'll be allowed to stay in the country with your family. But the very concept of citizenship, who should be a citizen of the United States, and how people should be allowed to become one, has been at the center of U.S. political debates for centuries. It was happening in the 18th century, and it's still happening today. Today in the U.S., according to the law, if you're born in this country, you're considered a citizen. Shout out to the 14th Amendment. But it wasn't always this way. For Black people in the 19th century, the question of whether they were, or could ever be, citizens of the United States was part of a decade-long court battle that centered on the circumstances of a Black man named Dred Scott. Though Scott's case, which ultimately ended up in the Supreme Court as Scott v. Sanford, was initially about whether one man would be able to live his life as free or enslaved, it became something much larger, centered on the very prospect and possibility of Black citizenship. Let's check it out. INTRO The person at the center of this case, Dred Scott, was an enslaved Black man who was living in Missouri. Historians estimate that he was born into slavery around the start of the 19th century in Southampton County, Virginia, and his enslaver was a man named Peter Blow. Scott was eventually purchased by an Army surgeon named John Emerson, who moved Scott from the enslaved state of Missouri to the Free State of Illinois, and then again to the Free Territory of Wisconsin. There Scott met and married his wife, Harriet Robinson, and they started a family. In 1840, John Emerson's wife Irene returned to St. Louis along with Dred Scott and his family. In 1843, John died suddenly, and Dred Scott and his family became the sole property of Irene. It's possible that Dred Scott attempted to buy he and his family's freedom from Irene, but from what historians can tell, she refused. So in 1846, Dred Scott filed a suit for his freedom in a St. Louis district court. His claim was based on Missouri law and precedent that if an enslaved person was relocated to a free state or territory, they were then considered free. And thus, they couldn't be re-enslaved upon entering a slave state. And since John Emerson had taken Dred Scott to live in both Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory at various points, both of which were free domains, it seemed like they had a pretty good case. After a bit of back and forth, Dred Scott did eventually win his family's freedom in 1850. But the case got appealed to Missouri's Supreme Court, which ruled against the lower court's decision while noting, quote, ""...times now are not as they were when the former decisions on the subject were made."" Dred Scott and his family were sent back into slavery. But Scott kept going. He received assistance from local abolitionists who helped him file suit in a federal court. By then, Irene had left Missouri and remarried. And for reasons historians have never quite figured out, the focus of the case went to her brother, John Sanford. The case eventually found its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. But once the case got there, things, to put it mildly, did not go well. The moment this case arrived at the Supreme Court was a pivotal one in the larger context of U.S. history, because it was a time in which the issue of slavery hugely animated the political debates in Washington as the country expanded. At the beginning of 1820, the United States was composed of 22 states, a big jump from the original 13 colonies. The Louisiana Purchase had doubled the land mass of the country, which meant that there were new states to admit. And what this did was create some real tension between the North and the South on the issue of slavery. Would the new states be free states? Slave states? Would they get to decide for themselves? Let's go to the Thought Bubble. The entire nation was dependent on slavery to some extent. But some states, as we've discussed, were more directly involved than others. So with predominantly northern states pushing to end slavery and southern states pushing to keep it in place, it became a bit of a moral and economic tug of war. This dispute led to the Missouri Compromise, which designated part of the Louisiana Purchase as free territory and part of it as slave territory, which would balance congressional power as more states entered the Union. This compromise, though, came at the expense of black people's lives. But as the United States expanded, more individuals wanted to travel across state lines. And that created some unique legal issues. The core of Dred Scott's legal argument was that he had lived in free areas of the country with his enslaver, Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory. The federal government at this time did not have specific legislation addressing the issue. So the United States Supreme Court was left to sort things out. If an enslaved person is moved from a slave state to a free state, is that individual now free? What if you're riding on a train leaving a slave state and pass through a free state? Is that black person free on the train while it's in the free state, but enslaved again when it passes back into the slave state? These were big questions that the country was wrestling with. And the stakes truly could not have been higher. Thanks Thought Bubble. The Supreme Court didn't buy Scott's arguments, and the justices cited 7-2 with Sanford. Chief Justice Roger Taney wrote in the majority opinion that Scott did not have the standing to sue because enslaved African Americans weren't citizens of the United States. And if that wasn't enough, Justice Taney stated that even free black people in the North could never be considered citizens. He wrote that black people, quote, are not included and were not intended to be included under the word citizens in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States. And in outlining the rationale for his decision, he stated that when the Constitution was framed and adopted, black people, quote, had no rights which the white man was bound to respect. I have a lot of feelings about Taney that are not appropriate to say in this video, so let's keep going before I get in trouble. What's more, Taney's decision declared that the ban on slavery was unconstitutional in territories that were part of the Louisiana Purchase, and it also upheld that neither Congress nor territorial governments had the power to ban slavery. This ruling infuriated abolitionists, who perceived this as an attempt to prevent any debate and discussion about how and where slavery would exist in the United States, and it further exacerbated the already high tensions on the issue. Historians point to the decision as one of the factors that more directly set the country on the path toward civil war. This was a consequential and deeply shameful moment in American history. Many historians consider it to be the worst Supreme Court decision ever, and it's hard not to agree. This decision created a new legal precedent that solidified black American status as an underclass. It kept them from being able to vote, from being able to defend themselves against explicit discrimination, or even domestic terrorism at the hands of white Americans. Black Americans were sometimes successful in court after Scott v. Sanford, but that wasn't the norm, and black people were now legally barred from filing suits at the federal level. What this did was limit the mobility of their cases. Even after the ratification of the 14th Amendment, which overturned Scott v. Sanford by upholding birthright citizenship, African Americans were still treated in accordance with the ideas that had been espoused in the case. And later in this series, we'll cover the experiences of black Americans between the 14th Amendment and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They weren't great. The Scott v. Sanford decision also hung like a shadow over U.S. immigration policy for decades. The Scott v. Sanford, though eventually overturned, perpetuated this idea that if you were not considered a white American, then you were not entitled to dignity or safety. These ideologies pushed immigrants to start proving in social settings and in court that they were white enough to have the benefits of citizenship, just to get the basic opportunities in the United States. And this created deeper divisions between black Americans and many immigrant populations. According to the Historical Construction of Race and Citizenship in the United States, a 2003 report done by the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development, quote, Harder to imagine is conferring on African Americans the degree of respect and recognition that would make them full and equal citizens in substance as well as in law. No other ethno-racial group was enslaved for two and a half centuries in what became the United States or, despite the attainment of de jure citizenship in 1868, was subjected to such an elaborate and comprehensive system of legalized discrimination and segregation. There is a long history of the incorporation of groups that initially inspired hostility and discrimination but which were able to exploit their putative whiteness to gain entry at the expense of the perennial other, the African Americans who remain to the present day, the principal negative reference group against which white or non-black America persists in defining itself. This is a powerful quote and a sobering one, and what it shows is that while there most certainly has been discrimination against many different groups of people throughout U.S. history, discrimination that must be taken seriously, there is a specific sort of insidiousness to the nature of anti-black racism that is important for us to understand if we are going to fully account for our history.

e1229394-d558-4462-90ba-60f46647283e,"Hi, I'm Clint Smith, and this is Crash Course Black American History. When you think of U.S. citizenship, you might think of your blue passport, or placing your hand over your heart and saying the Pledge of Allegiance, or waving an American flag as you watch fireworks during the Fourth of July with a plate full of barbecue. Citizenship is something that matters to people. Not only is citizenship a source of pride for many, but it has vast implications for how someone can live their life. It can determine where you work, where you can travel, whether or not you can vote, and even if you'll be allowed to stay in the country with your family. But the very concept of citizenship, who should be a citizen of the United States, and how people should be allowed to become one, has been at the center of U.S. political debates for centuries. It was happening in the 18th century, and it's still happening today. Today in the U.S., according to the law, if you're born in this country, you're considered a citizen. Shout out to the 14th Amendment. But it wasn't always this way. For Black people in the 19th century, the question of whether they were, or could ever be, citizens of the United States was part of a decade-long court battle that centered on the circumstances of a Black man named Dred Scott. Though Scott's case, which ultimately ended up in the Supreme Court as Scott v. Sanford, was initially about whether one man would be able to live his life as free or enslaved, it became something much larger, centered on the very prospect and possibility of Black citizenship. Let's check it out. INTRO The person at the center of this case, Dred Scott, was an enslaved Black man who was living in Missouri. Historians estimate that he was born into slavery around the start of the 19th century in Southampton County, Virginia, and his enslaver was a man named Peter Blow. Scott was eventually purchased by an Army surgeon named John Emerson, who moved Scott from the enslaved state of Missouri to the Free State of Illinois, and then again to the Free Territory of Wisconsin. There Scott met and married his wife, Harriet Robinson, and they started a family. In 1840, John Emerson's wife Irene returned to St. Louis along with Dred Scott and his family. In 1843, John died suddenly, and Dred Scott and his family became the sole property of Irene. It's possible that Dred Scott attempted to buy he and his family's freedom from Irene, but from what historians can tell, she refused. So in 1846, Dred Scott filed a suit for his freedom in a St. Louis district court. His claim was based on Missouri law and precedent that if an enslaved person was relocated to a free state or territory, they were then considered free. And thus, they couldn't be re-enslaved upon entering a slave state. And since John Emerson had taken Dred Scott to live in both Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory at various points, both of which were free domains, it seemed like they had a pretty good case. After a bit of back and forth, Dred Scott did eventually win his family's freedom in 1850. But the case got appealed to Missouri's Supreme Court, which ruled against the lower court's decision while noting, quote, ""...times now are not as they were when the former decisions on the subject were made."" Dred Scott and his family were sent back into slavery. But Scott kept going. He received assistance from local abolitionists who helped him file suit in a federal court. By then, Irene had left Missouri and remarried. And for reasons historians have never quite figured out, the focus of the case went to her brother, John Sanford. The case eventually found its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. But once the case got there, things, to put it mildly, did not go well. The moment this case arrived at the Supreme Court was a pivotal one in the larger context of U.S. history, because it was a time in which the issue of slavery hugely animated the political debates in Washington as the country expanded. At the beginning of 1820, the United States was composed of 22 states, a big jump from the original 13 colonies. The Louisiana Purchase had doubled the land mass of the country, which meant that there were new states to admit. And what this did was create some real tension between the North and the South on the issue of slavery. Would the new states be free states? Slave states? Would they get to decide for themselves? Let's go to the Thought Bubble. The entire nation was dependent on slavery to some extent. But some states, as we've discussed, were more directly involved than others. So with predominantly northern states pushing to end slavery and southern states pushing to keep it in place, it became a bit of a moral and economic tug of war. This dispute led to the Missouri Compromise, which designated part of the Louisiana Purchase as free territory and part of it as slave territory, which would balance congressional power as more states entered the Union. This compromise, though, came at the expense of black people's lives. But as the United States expanded, more individuals wanted to travel across state lines. And that created some unique legal issues. The core of Dred Scott's legal argument was that he had lived in free areas of the country with his enslaver, Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory. The federal government at this time did not have specific legislation addressing the issue. So the United States Supreme Court was left to sort things out. If an enslaved person is moved from a slave state to a free state, is that individual now free? What if you're riding on a train leaving a slave state and pass through a free state? Is that black person free on the train while it's in the free state, but enslaved again when it passes back into the slave state? These were big questions that the country was wrestling with. And the stakes truly could not have been higher. Thanks Thought Bubble. The Supreme Court didn't buy Scott's arguments, and the justices cited 7-2 with Sanford. Chief Justice Roger Taney wrote in the majority opinion that Scott did not have the standing to sue because enslaved African Americans weren't citizens of the United States. And if that wasn't enough, Justice Taney stated that even free black people in the North could never be considered citizens. He wrote that black people, quote, are not included and were not intended to be included under the word citizens in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States. And in outlining the rationale for his decision, he stated that when the Constitution was framed and adopted, black people, quote, had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.

f5b55966-7f26-46d4-b128-ba1be0d27526,"Hi, my name is Clint Smith and this is Crash Course Black American History. At this point, we've made clear that slavery was full of so many devastating and horrifying realities that no human being should have ever had to experience. The physical violence and torture that people were subjected to, the way so many families were separated and split apart, the way that your status as property was passed down from parent to child and from parent to child across generations. Among these horrifying realities is the way that someone could live in relative freedom for years and then, seemingly out of nowhere, be kidnapped by a slave catcher and brought back into bondage. Or brought into a bondage that they had never even known. It sounds like a nightmare, but it was real. And it's something that often left black folks living in free states with a profound sense of fear and anxiety even when they were just walking down the street. And it left many feeling like their freedom wasn't really that free at all. Today, we're going to learn about the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793. Let's start the show. INTRO Not long after the Revolutionary War and the adoption of the Constitution, a national debate arose on how to control fugitive slaves in the United States. There were multiple laws and policies created to prevent uprisings and rebellions, and to generally control the movement of enslaved people. But the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 is perhaps the most expansive, far-reaching manifestation of this effort. It was signed into law in February 1793 by President George Washington. And the act did three main things. One, it empowered enslavers to capture enslaved people who ran away from their plantations. This meant that any enslaver could bring an escaped enslaved person before any federal or state magistrate and reclaim the property the law said was theirs. Two, it stated that there was no need to have a trial by jury to return an enslaved person to bondage. It only required oral testimony from the person making the claim. And three, it stated that anyone who interfered with the recapturing of a fugitive slave could be fined, imprisoned, or sued by the enslaver. Part of why this matters from a legal standpoint is that the U.S. was still a really young country and was still trying to figure out how this constitution they had created would end up working in practice. And as you can imagine, given that they were British until just a few decades before, many of their legal principles were still heavily influenced by their mother country. An example of this is the concept of property rights, and even the very notion of what constitutes as property. The case that prompted the newly formed United States to more directly address how they were going to deal with fugitive enslaved persons was Somerset v. Stewart. This case happened a few years prior to the United States being officially founded, and it was actually an English case, but its outcome would determine how a nation on the verge of becoming its own would navigate the thorny question of fugitive slaves. In 1769, James Somerset, an enslaved person from what would become the United States, was brought to England by his enslaver, Charles Stewart, a man who had been a customs official while he was in Boston, but who was now moving back to Britain. In 1771, while still in England, Somerset ran away from Stewart, only to be recaptured about two months later. Stewart then had Somerset imprisoned on a ship bound for Jamaica to be sold into bondage on one of the plantations there. So in this case, Somerset was enslaved under Virginia law, but there was no comparable law justifying his enslavement in England. The absence of such a law led many British abolitionists to claim that slavery was thus unlawful in their country. A group of these abolitionists filed a writ of habeas corpus, a document used to determine if the detainment of an individual is legal, which ultimately led to the dispute. The British justice presiding over the case, Lord Mansfield, agreed with the abolitionists, to an extent, proclaiming that no enslaved person, quote, could be forcibly removed from Britain and sold into slavery. The ruling, though, didn't immediately free enslaved people in England, and it certainly didn't free enslaved people in the British colonies. This ruling presented a very real problem for Southerners in, remember, what was still then England's American colonies. Whatever the status of enslaved people following the decision, there was great concern about where the political winds were blowing. This fear and sense of anxiety became the backdrop of many debates on slavery during the founding of the United States, and it also led Southerners to push for constitutional protections that would preserve slavery and ensure that, if they escaped, enslaved people would be brought back to their enslavers. Thus, the Fugitive Slave Clause was born, not to be confused with the Fugitive Slave Act. The Fugitive Slave Clause said that, ""...no person held to service or labor in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due."" Let's go to the Thought Bubble. Though the Northerners allowed the Fugitive Slave Clause to be included in the Constitution, they did what a lot of lawmakers and law enforcement do when they don't like something. They just didn't enforce the law. From a moral standpoint, many Northerners viewed the Fugitive Slave Clause as kidnapping, and essentially decided that they would just ignore this portion of the Constitution. When the South said, Uh, hey guys, you're not really enforcing the law, the North was basically like, What? What's that? It's so loud in here I can't hear you over all of the moral inconsistency in the room. Anti-slavery sentiments were rising in the North, and some Northern states even started passing state laws banning the kidnapping of free people of color and criminalized wrongful enslavement. All of this prompted Southerners to move away from the Constitution as their main enforcement mechanism and instead use Congress to force the Northern states into compliance. So they went to Congress and started lobbying for a new law that would more consistently enforce the terms of the Fugitive Slave Clause. And what they got was basically a law that provided more details about how the spirit of the Fugitive Slave Clause could be put into practice. For example, the Fugitive Slave Act gave enslavers and slave catchers the right to go into free states and search for those who had escaped, and imposed a $500 fine on anyone who assisted escaped slaves or withheld information that would be helpful in their apprehension. And $500 is a lot of money now, but back in the 18th century, it was a whole lot of money. Thanks, Thought Bubble. So the legislators in Congress justified this by arguing that it was important for the Union to protect everyone's property rights, and that not enforcing the Fugitive Slave Clause was standing in the way of those rights. Individuals like Northern abolitionists, on the other hand, opposed the law, arguing that the act was unconstitutional because it curbed states' rights to make their own decisions on the issue of slavery. At the end of the day, though, the Southerners' argument won out, and the Fugitive Slave Act passed with a large majority in the House and no real opposition in the Senate. Abolitionists in the North were furious about this, and felt like it would turn many of the cities that served as a refuge for Black people into places where glorified, federally sanctioned bounty hunters roamed around kidnapping Black folks at will, regardless of whether or not they had actually been escaped slaves. A white person could effectively just lie and tell the court that someone was an escapee who belonged to them and claim them as their own. No jury, no due process, no nothing. Just a white person's word against the Black person's. And in 18th century America, you can probably guess whose word carried more weight. As a result of all this, many continued to ignore the laws in the Fugitive Slave Act just as they did with the Fugitive Slave Clause. But many other people readily took advantage of powers bestowed on them by this new law. Even our first president, George Washington, who signed the Fugitive Slave Act into law, used that very act in an attempt to recapture Ona Judge, an enslaved woman who was living and working at the President's house in Philadelphia. When she learned in 1796 she was going to be given to one of Martha Washington's granddaughters, she ran away. George Washington was supposedly furious, writing to his Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Walcott Jr., the ingratitude of the girl, who was brought up and treated more like a child than a servant. She ought not to escape with impunity if it can be avoided. Judge was later tracked down in New Hampshire. Customs Collector Joseph Whipple talked to her and wrote to Washington that Judge would willingly return if she could be freed after George and Martha passed away. But this wasn't good enough for Washington, who demanded that she be returned immediately. At the same time, however, he knew that many of the northern states would not react happily to him, the President of the United States, tracking down an escaped slave. He wanted her returned, but also didn't want it to become some sort of public spectacle. So he wrote to Whipple, I do not mean, however, by this request, that such violent measures should be used as would excite a mob or riot. A few years later, Martha's nephew Burwell Bassett Jr. was in New Hampshire and tried to take Judge by force, but New Hampshire Senator John Langdon heard the plan and sent a messenger to Judge, allowing her to escape. The Fugitive Slave Act made clear to even more people that slavery was an inhumane enterprise. The spectacle of people being pulled from the streets, from their communities, from their homes, and brought back down south was horrifying, and for some in the North, forced them to see and confront the insidiousness of the institution for the very first time. There was no averting their eyes from this. And looking back, we shouldn't avert our eyes either. As has been the case with so much of the violence that Black people have experienced, we have to look at it directly, and sit with it, in order to understand it. I'll see you next time. Thanks for watching."
785e053c-3746-455d-9837-06cc0622a394,"Hey there, I'm Mike Rugnetta, welcome to Crash Course Theater, and today we're going to be covering Greek satyr plays and classical Greek comedy. We'll also take a look at Aristophanes' Lysistrata, a play in which the women of Athens and Sparta decide to ban sexual intercourse until their husbands stop fighting a war. It might get a little lewd, but this play is actually a lot less lewd than most Greek comedies that came before it. So the next time you're at a museum, staring up at some noble piece of ancient marble statuary just remember, those folks loved a good fart joke. INTRO Satyr plays are the raunchy plays that appear at the conclusion of each tragic trilogy. They're meant to cheer an audience up after all that pity and fear and purgation. And what did audiences find most cheerful? You guessed it, phalli. Like tragedies, satyr plays were usually derived from mythological stories. Unlike tragedies, satyr plays featured a chorus dressed as satyrs. Ears, tails, shaggy legs, and tie-on phalluses. They presented goofy versions of important legends. Here's your typical myth, going along as planned, and then who shows up but horse dudes. These plays normally focus on how fun-loving, drunk, and cowardly the satyrs are, but there are often a few human characters who engage in serious moral debate at some point. Only one complete satyr play survives, and that's Euripides' Cyclops, based on an episode in The Odyssey. It's almost a retelling of the Odyssey's version, except there are a lot of satyrs on the Cyclops island, and they're the ones who get Odysseus into trouble with mean old Mr. Unipupil. While trying to avoid being eaten, Odysseus takes a moment to engage the Cyclops in an earnest debate on whether duty or pleasure-seeking is the key to a happy life. After that, the Cyclops and the head satyr Silenus get very drunk, and Silenus gets dragged off to maybe do Cyclops sex stuff, but then Odysseus blinds the Cyclops and it ends happily for all. Except the Cyclops, who is blinded and was probably like, ugh, that was my one good eye. You may remember from a couple episodes ago the drama contests of Dionysia. In 486 BCE, a separate contest for comedy was established, with five competitors each year. In classical Greece, comedy was pretty raucous and pretty ribald. The word comedy comes to us from the Greek word komoidea, which literally means party song. After 40 years or so, comedy got popular enough that it had its own festival, the linea, held in winter for Athenians only. No foreign dignitaries, which maybe makes sense because these comedies were probably not how Athens wanted to represent itself to the world. Like tragedies, comedies were inspired by the philosophies and problems of present-day Athens. But while tragedies tended to cloak their relevance in the mythic past or foreign lands, comedies were typically set in contemporary Athens, poking merciless fun at contemporaneous life. They kept themselves safe by being so wild and crazy that you couldn't possibly take their political attacks seriously. Though there are records of at least a couple lawsuits. Spoil sports. Comedies differed from tragedies in that they often depended upon spectacular effects and featured funny costumes like padded stomachs and butts and yes, of course, say it with me now, though I would totally understand if it makes you uncomfortable and you super don't want to, phalluses. Most of the formal elements—dialogic scenes interspersed with choral odes—were similar to tragedy, but comedy included something new. It was the parabasis, a speech in which the chorus addresses the audience directly. And while tragedies focus on some noble figure falling, comedies are often about the little guy struggling to rise. Though, as we'll see with the Lysistrata, comedies can deal with great figures and serious subjects as well. Unfortunately, few examples survive from the golden age of classical comedy, and all the ones that do are by Aristophanes. But we have fragments by many others, including Eupolis, a comedy writer so beloved that according to legend, when he died fighting a war, the government passed a law exempting all poets from military service. Let's take a moment to look at what separates comedies from satire plays. Satire plays are situated in a mythic past, and comedies are in the present. Satire plays are typically rural, and comedies are usually urban. Satire plays are about messing things up. Comedies are about putting things back together. They tend to return social order and conclude with a compromise of some kind—a peace treaty, a constitution, a marriage. There's not necessarily any reconciliation at the end of a satire play, while comedies are about offering absurd suggestions to real problems. Aristophanes is the most famous figure of classical comedy for the very good reason that his plays are the ones that still exist. Invading hordes? You are the worst. He wrote at least 40 plays. We have 11. Aristophanes was born into a wealthy Athenian family sometime in the 450s. He started writing early, and he was almost immediately known for his splendid poetry and for relentlessly mocking specific political figures. In fact, he was sued at least once for unpatriotic behavior. Undeterred, Aristophanes kept the poetry and dirty jokes and mockery coming for quite some time. Late in the 5th century BCE, though, Athens started losing the Peloponnesian War to Sparta, and a lot of things changed, including comedy. Suddenly, it wasn't such a great idea to satirize political figures, and Athens didn't have as much money to spend on spectacular effects and fancy choruses. So Aristophanes made a mid-career switch. He started writing plays for smaller choruses and with composite comic figures, rather than specific real-life politicians. Aristophanes has a lot of famous plays—The Birds, The Clouds, The Frogs. But today, we're going to look at The Lysistrata, which we chose for a couple reasons. For one, it's still relevant. In the early days of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, thousands of theater companies staged readings and productions of this play. The Lysistrata's frustration at the senselessness of wars and the tolls they exact won't seem very ancient to us. Also, it's one of the rare ancient comedies in which the women get to be really funny, so that's nice. But also remember that all the actors in ancient Greek theater were men. And all the playwrights, too. Anyways, let's go to the Thought Bubble. The Lysistrata won first prize in 411 BCE, at which point the Peloponnesian War had waged for about twenty years. Athens and Sparta together defeated an enemy once thought unstoppable—the Persians. But after their victory, they squabbled over colonies. Sparta had the superior land army. Athens had the superior navy. Athens was a democracy. Sparta was an oligarchy. Athens had a lot of money. And Sparta had a lot of staying power. Things got ugly and stayed ugly. Also, Athens had a plague that killed a lot of its citizens and its great leader, Pericles. That definitely did not help. So this is the background story for the Lysistrata, at the start of which the women of Athens are fed up. They're tired of war, they're tired of being poor, and they're really, really tired of their husbands leaving to fight. Because when their husbands are away, they can't have sex. So, led by a woman named Lysistrata, they devise a so-far-fetched-it-just-might-work plan. They seize control of the Acropolis, which is where Athens keeps all of its money. And they say they're not going to give up the siege, and they will not have any sex until the men stop fighting. To show that they're really serious, they get a bunch of women from warring areas, like Sparta and Corinth, to join them. The women swear an oath and achieve a truce, showing the men that it can be done. Thanks, Thought Bubble. I would love to quote the chaste lady's oath for you, but it's a family show, and the oath is filthy, which is sort of the point. To begin with, the women prepare a sacrificial victim, but instead of killing an animal, the sacrifice they make is to open a jug of wine, which they're obviously going to chug. And then they swear to not let any man near them. But the joke is that the oath they take is really specific. It's not just that they're swearing off sex, they're swearing in great detail about exactly the kind of sex they're not going to have. Like, exactly, exactingly exact. This is one of the things that Greek comedy does. It makes fun of beliefs and rituals that are often held sacred, but it doesn't satirize. The point isn't to show that oaths are ridiculous, or that the goals of women are absurd. The point is to make fun of social conventions with the end goal of creating a better and happier society. So cheers to that. In a patriarchal society like Ancient Greece, by the way, the idea of women seizing power was also pretty funny in itself. For the men. Because it was just so impossible. The women might have had different ideas. Most of the jokes are about how difficult it is to go without sex. Women keep pretending to be hurt or pregnant in order to sneak out of the Acropolis. Men come to try to entice their wives back into bed. And in one of the funniest scenes, a wife agrees, but then she keeps making more and more demands of her husband. She needs a mattress. She needs a pillow. And then she runs back into the Acropolis at the last minute, leaving her husband with an epic case of frustration. At the end, Lysistrata comes out of the Acropolis and meets with Athenian and Spartan delegates. She reminds them of what they owe to each other and how ridiculous this conflict is. Yet they agree to peace, not because Lysistrata is so wise, but because the goddess of reconciliation is there, personified as a naked woman, and they all want to have sex with her. Which is creepy. And misogynist. And violent. And then there's a banquet and the newly reconciled men and women sing and dance together. From this, you can get a sense of how delightful and radical Greek comedy is, while also maybe being kinda troubling? Suggesting the absurdity of a vicious and expensive war is a pretty racy thing for an Athenian play to do when Athens is still in the middle of that war. But this isn't a bleak satire. It has a happy ending, with its enthusiastic embrace of food and wine and singing and dancing and it tries to show that peace is possible and preferable. If maybe also kind of ruined by creepin' dudes. Thanks for watching. Next time we'll look at the transition from Greek theater to Roman theater and the rise of popular entertainments that'll make the Lysistrata seem tame. But until then, kerting."
8ba938c4-3ad7-41ac-abfa-bb57623f5883,"Hi, my name is Clint Smith and this is Crash Course Black American History. So, if you look at the tag on the shirt that you're wearing, you'll probably find that at least a portion of it is made of cotton. I mean, cotton is everywhere. It's in our shirts, in our pants, in curtains, in blankets, in so many other things that we don't even realize. But even though that cotton on your back was meant to keep you comfortable, the historical reality of the United States is that the cotton industry was built on the backs of black folks. A lot of cotton is grown in the hot and humid climate of the southern United States, and a lot of this country's wealth was built on the cotton trade. But it's easy to forget that part of the reason that cotton was so lucrative in early America was because it was harvested with the labor of enslaved people. And even though the dirty work of the cotton industry took place mainly in the southern states, many white people in the northern United States gained their fortunes through the exploitation of enslaved workers in the south. And the reason that cotton became such a central economic pillar was not just because of what was happening in the US, but because of an entire global financial network that, whether they sanctioned the use of slavery themselves or not, incentivized the use of enslaved labor to satisfy the enormous international demand for cotton. It's time we learn about how cotton became king. Let's start the show. Intro By the time of the Civil War, the United States was wealthy. I'm talking Scrooge McDuck swimming in golden coins rich. It had become one of the major slave trading capitals of the world and a major exporter of cotton. According to scholar Henry Louis Gates, cotton was the first mass consumer commodity. Which is just a fancy way of saying that everybody in the world wanted it. They wanted it for their clothes, for their blankets, for their rugs, for their socks. I mean, demand across the globe was exploding. The cotton industry was so powerful that it not only grew the US economy, but many economies in Europe as well. But most nations couldn't compete with the United States production level. According to historian Edward Baptist, the North American interior had thousands of acres of possible cotton fields, thousands for each one in the Caribbean. And in order to develop all of this land, there was a greater need for laborers to work the cotton plantations of the South and Mid-Atlantic United States. And as had become standard practice in the US in the 18th and 19th centuries, the plan was for most of these laborers to be enslaved black people. Enslaved labor and cotton went hand in hand to produce profit. And the work, it was more than just backbreaking, it was torture. Charles Ball, a black man and author who escaped slavery, wrote that the brutality of the cotton industry was enough to make an individual contemplate taking their own life. He said in his 1837 autobiography, Slavery in the United States, quote, Surely if anything can justify a man in taking his life into his own hands and terminating his existence, no one can attach blame to the slaves on many of the cotton plantations of the South when they cut short their breath and the agonies of the present being by a single stroke. What is life worth amidst hunger, nakedness, and excessive toil under the continually uplifted lash? It really doesn't get more clear than that. And in 1793, the cotton gin arrived, and it transformed the cotton industry, the global economy, and in horrific ways, the lives of enslaved people. The cotton gin significantly ramped up cotton production in the United States, especially in South Carolina and Georgia. Let's check that out in the Thought Bubble. Before 1793, separating the sticky seeds from cotton was a laborious task. Then, the mechanical cotton gin invented by Eli Whitney made the process much faster and easier than it had ever been. What would happen is that cotton would be threaded through a wooden drum filled with hooks that caught hold of the fibers and pulled them through a mesh. The holes in that mesh were too small to allow the seeds through, but the cotton fibers themselves were easily pulled through. While some larger gins would later be powered by horses and even steam engines, Whitney used a smaller version. Whitney's hand-cranked machine could remove the seeds from 50 pounds of cotton in a single day. What this meant was that planters needed a way to grow and pick more cotton to keep up with the new accelerated pace of processing. And at the same time, market conditions in Europe meant cotton was more desirable than ever. What this meant was that planters needed even more labor from even more enslaved workers than they did before. Demand for other industrial cotton machinery grew as well, like new machines for spinning cotton or steamboats to transport massive bales of it. This drastically changed the American economic landscape. By the 1850s, cotton provided three-fifths of American exports, and the yield of raw cotton doubled every decade after 1800. By some estimates, the United States supplied three-quarters of the global supply of cotton by the start of the Civil War. If cotton wasn't king before, it certainly was now. Thanks, Thought Bubble. The economic impact of the cotton industry on the United States and the enslaved people whose labor sustained it is very clear. Again, historian Edward Baptist writes, All told, more than $600 million, or almost half of the economic activity in the United States in 1836, derived directly or indirectly from cotton produced by the million-odd slaves, 6 percent of the total U.S. population who in that year toiled in labor camps on slavery's frontier. And again, it wasn't just the United States, it was the world. Most of the Western world's economies benefited from the cotton industry. Historian Gene Dattle argues that cotton produced by enslaved people was the driving force for territorial expansion in the Old Southwest and fostered trade between Europe and the United States. Major northern cities, like New York City, needed raw cotton for their own industries. New England was also seriously dependent on raw cotton for the textile revolution. New England mills consumed 283.7 million pounds of cotton, or 67 percent of the cotton used by U.S. mills in 1860. So any notion that the North wasn't intimately involved in slavery is something we should immediately toss out the window. Abroad, countries like Britain and France also depended on raw cotton. According to Gene Dattle, Britain, the most powerful nation in the world, relied on slave-produced cotton for over 80 percent of its essential industrial raw material. English textile mills accounted for 40 percent of Britain's exports. One-fifth of Britain's 22 million people were directly or indirectly involved with cotton textiles. And it didn't stop there. One of the main causes of the Civil War was cotton, and the status of the enslaved laborers who produced that cotton. Southern slaveholders were so financially attached to the cotton industry that they were willing to go to war over it. And at the end of the war, cotton was one of the bargaining tools that the South used to assure that they would still have a place, and political power, in the Union. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. We'll get to the Civil War soon. Now, let's do some deeper thinking about the economic implications of slavery. In 1860, in large part tied to the explosion of the cotton industry, the 4 million enslaved people in the United States were worth more than all of the railroads and factories in the nation combined. Those enslaved workers were worth more than all of the manufacturing in the United States. So Black people's labor has played an enormous role in America's ascent as a global economic superpower. But enslaved people themselves didn't get to reap the benefits of the economic explosion they created. The vast majority of Black folks were not allowed to own any property. And if they did, it could be seized from them at any moment, without them being able to do much of anything about it. Even when slavery was abolished, the sharecropping system in the South worked in similar ways, plunging Black Americans and their families into devastating debt while they owned nothing of their own. The implications of this are profound. Let's step back and consider that intergenerational chattel slavery in the United States, in which Black people rarely owned their own land, lasted for 250 years before ending, technically at least, in 1865. Let's then consider that sharecropping, in which enormous numbers of Black people continued to not own their own land, lasted well into the 1950s and arguably later. This directly impacts generational wealth in the United States today. If your family was able to accrue income, equity, and mobility by owning land that produced cotton, or any other crop for that matter, and then pass it down across generations, it would quite naturally leave your descendants in a more economically secure position than those who came before them. But Black folks, despite working the land, cultivating the land, and picking the cotton and crops that grew on the land, for the most part, didn't have any opportunity to reap the financial benefits of that land. What this did was leave many Black families, well after slavery ended and into the 20th century, with little, if anything, to pass down to their children, something that shapes the sort of opportunities that their descendants would or would not have. And this gap between White and Black people is compounded decade after decade after decade until it's no longer a gap in wealth, it's a gulf. Cotton was the United States' biggest export for more than a century. That's more than 100 years of wealth creation and industry that Black Americans not only carried on their backs, but were designated to never profit from. I mean, calling it a head start for White people doesn't even accurately capture it. It wasn't just a head start, it was like you were running while the person you're racing against had chains on their feet and death threats in their ears. So when we talk about creating a more equitable nation, part of what we have to think about is how to account for, and make amends for, what was done to people and what was kept from people for generations. The question remains, how can we compensate those who this country purposefully left behind? Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.

4efbad06-a3cc-437d-8cc0-8b7640c487ef,"Hi, I'm Clint Smith, and this is Crash Course Black American History. Imagine living in a place where your labor exists primarily for someone else's benefit. Now, imagine living in a country where motions to pass laws that would benefit your greater good largely go ignored, and where you feel like the governing body that creates the laws that shape your life don't represent you or your best interests. Imagine being regularly surveilled and watched by people with guns. Imagine being convicted of crimes without a trial by jury. Imagine your seas plundered, your coast ravaged, your towns burnt down, the lives of your people destroyed. And all of that, on top of having to pay taxes, without having any sort of meaningful representation. Oh, I'm sorry, did you think I was talking about black people? Oh no, I was actually going down the list of grievances the American colonists outlined for Great Britain in the Declaration of Independence. Which is interesting given what so many of these same colonists would do to black people both during and after the revolution. Now imagine you're a black person living in colonial America, and a war for independence, freedom, and certain unalienable rights is taking place right in front of you. But the freedom being fought for is one that would largely only benefit white Americans. Not you. The American Revolution, hypocritical as it may have seemed to black people, did provide some opportunities for enslaved people to gain their freedom. Some did so by fighting for and aligning themselves with the Americans, while others fled to fight for the British. Over 200,000 people served in the American Army during the Revolutionary War. Historians have determined that anywhere from 5,000 to 8,000 of these troops were of African descent. Some were forced to take up arms when able-bodied men were needed to fight on behalf of the colonists. Others willingly did so as a show of goodwill, hoping to convince enslavers that black people were Americans too, and were thus also worthy of all the rights that these American colonists were fighting for, for themselves. At the same time, there were also a lot of black people who calculated that they should take their chances fighting for the British crown, because it was actually the British who seemed more likely to widely enforce emancipation in the event of their victory. It's estimated that some 20,000 black men would end up fighting for the British Army, far more than the number who fought for the Americans. No matter which side they were fighting for, though, there is no question that black people played a significant role in the war. And one of the most important figures of the Revolutionary War was a black man named Crispus Attucks. And why was he so famous? Well, it's said that he was the first person to be killed as part of the Revolutionary Cause. Man, for some reason, whether it's movies in the 90s or 18th century revolutions, black people always seem to be the first ones to go. But I digress. So Crispus Attucks died during the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770, on a cold March evening, British troops fired into a crowd of angry Americans who had been taunting them. Five colonists were killed, and the Americans were absolutely furious. It amplified the already heated tensions with the British and served as a major catalyst for the Revolution. A sailor and a rope maker, Crispus Attucks hailed from Framingham, Massachusetts. As far as we know, he was a runaway. In 1750, someone in Framingham put out an advertisement in search of a 27-year-old, 6'2"", short and curly-haired mulatto fellow. And though he was called mulatto, a pejorative name that was given to people of mixed white and black ancestry, Attucks was likely of African and Native American descent. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. Crispus was at a local tavern when an altercation between a few angry colonists and a British soldier began escalating nearby. When the town bell rang, Crispus joined the swelling crowd to see what all the commotion was about. At some point, he stepped to the front of the crowd wielding a large wooden stick, joining other armed men ready to defend themselves against the British troops. There are two versions of what happened next. Version 1. Samuel Adams, leader of the Sons of Liberty and namesake of the beer brand founded many years later, says Attucks was simply leaning on his stick when he was shot by the British and that he posed no threat to anyone in those moments before he was killed. Version 2. According to an enslaved man named Andrew, who testified as an eyewitness, Crispus threw himself into the mayhem, striking at least two soldiers before he was struck down. Remember though, that an enslaved person's testimony has to be understood in the context of the power dynamics at hand. In any case, what seems to have happened is that as the colonists rained fire, well, snowballs, on the British, somehow, whether accidentally or deliberately, a weapon went off. This startled both the crowd and the royal soldiers. Believing that their officer had ordered them to open fire, the rest of the soldiers started shooting at the angry mob of colonists. The cause of Crispus Attucks' death was two musket balls to the chest. Thanks Thought Bubble. Future U.S. President John Adams served as one of the British soldiers' defense attorneys. According to a trial transcript, he said that Attucks was a stout mulatto fellow whose very looks was enough to terrify any person. John Adams, man. Yikes. We should note, though, that this is part of a long history of making Black people seem beast-like to justify the violence that was used against them. Little did Adams know, however, that Attucks would emerge as one of the most significant figures in the war, ultimately becoming a symbol of Black patriotism and sacrifice. There were several other Black Americans who played a part in other pivotal moments during the war. For example, Peter Salem, Caesar, Pharaoh, Salem Poor, and Barzilai Lou served on the American side during the Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775. The Americans actually lost that battle, but it was one in which they inflicted significant casualties to the British, which gave them the confidence that they indeed could go toe to toe with their royal adversaries. But as we've said, Black people fighting for the American forces wasn't always a given. The commander-in-chief of this whole thing, George Washington, didn't allow Black men to serve in the military. Because well, from his perspective and others, giving weapons to thousands of enslaved Black men and having them fight alongside the men who enslaved them didn't seem like the smartest idea. But as it became clear that the colonists' reservoir of white manpower was dwindling, he quickly changed his mind. Unfortunately for Washington, fighting for the British was a more compelling prospect for the majority of Black people. On November 7, 1775, Royal Governor Lord Dunmore promised freedom to enslaved Black people if they ran away from their Virginia enslavers and fought for the British in the war. Dunmore's proclamation announced martial law in the colony, declaring, ""...all indentured servants, Negroes or others free, that are able and willing to bear arms, they joining His Majesty's troops, as soon as may be, for the more speedily reducing this colony to a proper dignity."" The proclamation sparked outrage in the colony and ignited a fierce rebuke from the colonists. But even though Dunmore was hoping to receive droves of men anxious to jump into battle, historian Woody Houlton tells us that half of those who joined him and survived the war were women and children. The Ethiopian Regiment, as Lord Dunmore's military unit would be called, was composed of around 300 Black men who fled their enslavers in Virginia. Unfortunately, this unit went on to lose the only major battle they fought, the Battle of Great Bridge, on December 9, 1775. Still, this unit of Black soldiers fighting for the British against the slave-holding colonists had profound symbolic importance. One significant result was that it inspired many other enslaved people to run away. The British, though, weren't the only ones to employ this tactic. In 1778, Rhode Island declared that they would allow both free and enslaved Black Americans to participate in the war, promising freedom to enslaved men who would join them. Consisting of only 130 men, this regiment was pretty small, but their service was hailed widely. For many Black people, particularly those who were enslaved, who you fought for during the Revolution was less about allegiance to any particular side and more a calculation about your best opportunity for freedom. According to historian Benjamin Quarles, the Negro's role in the Revolution can be best understood by realizing that his major loyalty was not to a place, nor to a people, but to a principle. No matter which side they were fighting for, what enslaved people hoped was to prove that they were just as worthy of freedom as those who were fighting alongside them. And this idea of Black people using military service as a means of legitimating their claim and right to freedom is something that we'll see come up again and again throughout all of American history. In the midst of all the rhetoric about liberty and justice for all, what became clear to many is that this revolution was largely intended for white colonists' independence. The emancipation of all enslaved Black people wouldn't occur for another 80 years. What's more, losing the war nullified any promises the British had made to many Black people about gaining their freedom, and many of them even faced re-enslavement after the end of the war. The British retreat left Black people in an incredibly vulnerable position. Runaways were prevented from gaining passage on British ships and were meant to be returned to the custody of American officials. There were many, however, that did make it onto British ships, though they weren't necessarily destined for freedom. Some 15,000 Black loyalists ended up in places like Australia, Sierra Leone, Canada, England, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. And despite the promises that had been made, some of these passengers were resold into slavery in other British colonies. Unfortunately, the American Revolution did not result in the large-scale freedom for Black people in America as it did for their white counterparts. And only a relative few were granted the freedom they fought for and had been promised. But what remains true is that without Black people's contributions on either side, the war would have looked fundamentally different than it did. Black participation in the American Revolution would not be the last time Black men would fight alongside white men in wartime, even when they weren't sure that they would be allowed to reap the benefits of victory. And as I mentioned before, we'll see that military service and the prospect of freedom for Black people back home has a long, complicated relationship throughout American history. And we'll learn more about that soon. Thanks for watching, I'll see you next time."
6cdddd3d-eb32-446a-9e67-8226e4c6d860,"Hi, my name's Clint Smith, and this is Crash Course Black American History. So sometimes in life, who we say we want to be is not necessarily who we are in that moment. For example, when I was a little kid, I wanted to be a pro wrestler. And not, like, grow up and become one eventually. I wanted to be one right then, right there, in that moment. Now, the thing is, even if I wrote down on a sheet of paper that I was a pro wrestler, even if I got all my friends to meet in a room and agree that I was a pro wrestler, even if I got all those friends to sign a long scroll of paper calling me a pro wrestler, none of that, in fact, makes me a professional wrestler. See, there's a disconnect there between who I say I want to be and who I actually am in that moment. This is basically the same thing that happened with the US Constitution. Stay with me. America said a lot of things about who it was and what it represented, even though for millions of people, the aspirations espoused in that document didn't apply to them. And not only did it not apply to them, but it further entrenched the racial caste system that was already in place. You see, who America says it is, and who America has actually been, have not always been neatly aligned. Far from it. It's more than a little ironic that the place where the US Constitution was drafted was later called Independence Hall. Because while it's true that the United States was effectively born there, there were millions of people who called the United States home who, in many ways, became even less free following the ratification of the Constitution. Now, this is not to imply that the colonial laws we've talked about in earlier episodes weren't restricting or inhumane in their own right. They were. But the Constitution, even in its earliest days when so many people around the world weren't really sure what a constitution even was, was intended as an effort to solidify the legal principles of a nation. In the United States, the Constitution is the central legal document of our land. It is the thing that everything else comes back to. And in our foundational legal document, the one upon which the legal and political landscape of this country would be built, the Founders failed to do away with slavery. In fact, they recommitted to it. And there were many people who felt strongly that this was a moral indictment of the country. Almost 70 years later, in 1854, the famous abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison would hold up a copy of the U.S. Constitution and burn it, calling it a covenant with death and an agreement with hell. And it didn't have to be this way. The Founders could have used this as an opportunity to say, hey, look, let's start this experiment fresh. They could have said, you know what team, we inherited slavery from the British, we just fought a war of independence, and that means we should probably make everyone independent. But instead, the majority of them were like, nah. And the thing is, so many of them knew slavery was wrong. And so many of them knew that it was something they should be ashamed of. That's why the word slave didn't actually appear anywhere in the Constitution. They didn't want it anywhere on the document because they knew that it was something history would judge them for. This matters because it demonstrates what many Founders of our nation valued and where they thought that Black people should be on the social hierarchy. On an economic front, slavery was an incredibly lucrative business, and the Founders knew that, many of them personally. Of the 55 delegates at the Constitutional Convention, about 25 owned and slaved people. This conflict manifested itself in two ways, the Three-Fifths Compromise and the Slave Trade Clause. Let's start with the Three-Fifths Compromise. Article 1 of the Constitution set up a government with two legislative chambers. In the Senate, each state gets two senators, but in the House of Representatives, representation is determined by the population of the state. And these newly minted states had very different compositions. Northern states were more densely populated with white citizens, while southern states were heavily populated with enslaved Black people. What this did was create a dilemma. The colonists were unsure if and how they should acknowledge enslaved Black people as members of the population, and to what extent they should be counted as citizens in the context of allotting states political representation. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. Northern delegates did not support including enslaved Black people in the population of the southern states, largely because it would give the South more political power. But the southern delegates knew they wouldn't be able to compete in the House of Representatives if enslaved people weren't counted. And this is where we get something called the Three-Fifths Compromise. The Three-Fifths Compromise was a clause in the Constitution that defined enslaved individuals as three-fifths of a human. It was placed in Article 1, Section 2, and it stated that, Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this Union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other persons. Three-fifths of a person. That doesn't even make sense to say out loud. And it sounds absurd, because it is absurd. Even though the South would have loved for Black people to fully count for political purposes, this legislative compromise, which turned Black people into fractions, came to serve as a larger metaphor for the way that Black people were seen by many as less than human. The implications of this decision were profound. It changed the dynamics of the House of Representatives and the Electoral College. Without the Three-Fifths Compromise, some historians even argue that Thomas Jefferson would have never won the election of 1800. Thanks Thought Bubble. The Three-Fifths Compromise wasn't the only negotiation about what slavery would look like in the new United States. The Slave Trade Clause was outlined in Article 1, Section 9, Clause 1 of the Constitution. Although it doesn't use the word slave, it was one of the original provisions of the Constitution that addressed slavery as a policy issue. The text says, The migration or importation of such persons, as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year 1808. But a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person. This is basically a really fancy way of saying that the federal government cannot limit how many individuals were imported to the United States. According to legal scholars Gordon Lloyd and Jenny S. Martinez, when they said any such persons, they clearly meant enslaved people of African descent. They also point out that this clause was created to be another compromise between the northern and southern colonies. It allowed for slavery to exist in the South, where it directly sustained the economy, and allowed for slavery to remain illegal at the local level, where it had already been abolished. But what it did allow was for all the colonies to indirectly, economically benefit from slavery. And the fact that so many across the country, north and south, benefited financially from slavery is part of what allowed it to sustain itself for so long. Some states, like Georgia and South Carolina, had a unique reliance on the transatlantic slave trade because their enslaved workers died at higher rates relative to places like Virginia or Maryland. They were particularly insistent on this point, so much that some feared they wouldn't join the Union if there were constitutional limits placed on the slave trade. So even though this document was written without saying the word slave, what this clause essentially said was, until 1808, the migration or importation of enslaved individuals of African descent cannot be regulated by the federal government, but only by the states, to allow for each entity to make the best economic decision for their white citizens. At the end of the day, southern states were able to benefit by keeping their property, and northern states, we shouldn't forget, also got to benefit from the impact of slavery on the northern economy. The Slave Trade Clause prevented action on the transatlantic slave trade for 20 years, and the Three-Fifths Compromise lasted for a lot longer than that. It took 75 years before the United States eventually pivoted on slavery, and it took a civil war and cost hundreds of thousands of lives to get there. So what can we say about the Constitutional Convention? I mean, what can we say about the Founding Fathers? So often we're taught about how great they were, and how great this founding document they wrote is. But remember that nearly half of the delegates at the Constitutional Convention owned enslaved people. It's important to understand who was and who wasn't included in their vision for this new nation, who would be the beneficiaries of this promise of democracy, and whose bodies would be used and cast aside in pursuit of it. Sometimes American history demands that we hold sets of complicated truths at the same time. These delegates at the Constitutional Convention founded a country that would go on to create unprecedented opportunity and upward mobility for millions of people across generations. But it did so at the direct expense of millions and millions of other people. Both are true. And both are America. And holding multiple truths that seem at odds with one another, well, that's American history in a nutshell. I'll see you next time.

5c44c174-b7b2-4a7a-b392-f3ba2e75c10e,"Hi, I'm Clint Smith, and this is Crash Course Black American History. If you're like me, when you first heard of this thing called the Underground Railroad as a kid, you imagined a vast network of steam engines that criss-crossed the southern United States in dark tunnels surrounded by soil and rough. These trains, I thought, carried enslaved people from the violence of their plantations to the freedom of northern cities. I imagined it kind of like the subway system of New York City, except with a lot less rats. Some writers, like the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Colson Whitehead, have even imagined this real-life train system in their stories, depicting the Underground Railroad as something that traversed across the South, making stops in each state to collect enslaved people who had escaped and were trying to make their way to freedom. But the reality is, despite what third-grade Clint thought, the Underground Railroad wasn't an actual railroad. It was, in fact, something even more remarkable. It was a group of people who used their homes, their heads, and their hearts to secretly help enslaved people make their way out of the South and toward what they hoped would be a better future. These were people, black and white alike, who often risked everything to help people they didn't even know. But they helped them because they knew that slavery was wrong, and they wanted to play whatever small role they could in helping as many people as possible reach freedom. The Underground Railroad is an incredible part of American history, and it is also something that has been mythologized in ways that aren't always accurate. But today, we're going to separate fact from fiction. Let's get started. So we've established that the Underground Railroad wasn't an actual railroad. But it's also important to know that even the metaphorical railroad wasn't a centrally organized endeavor. There were no headquarters, no comprehensive maps, no Underground Railroad magazine. Many people who we now view as part of the Underground Railroad across the country didn't actually know anything about one another. The Underground Railroad was made of individuals and small networks of people working together amid the larger, less centralized operation. And while the Underground Railroad wasn't a literal train, they did often use the language of train infrastructure. The various stops and safe houses could be known as stations, the guides who led the escapees to different stations were conductors, and the folks who hid escaped slaves in their homes might be known as station masters. Harriet Tubman, among the most famous conductors, used this sort of language herself, saying in 1896, quote, I was the conductor of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I can say what most conductors can't say, I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger. It's unclear where the term Underground Railroad first originated, but it's said to have first appeared in an 1839 newspaper. Frederick Douglass alludes to it in his 1845 autobiography, where he expresses frustration at the abolitionists who have been talking about the network with such a lack of discretion that he says it's turning the operation into an upper ground railroad. See, Douglass thought that this might compromise the entire operation. He wanted it to be something more covert, more underground. Sometimes when people tell the story of the Underground Railroad, what they imagine, and what some early scholars depicted in their own work, was a network made primarily of benevolent white abolitionists who helped escape slaves who couldn't help themselves. And while there were many white abolitionists who were absolutely involved in the system, sometimes this story can lead to many people ignoring or erasing the fact that it was mostly black people who were part of, and who led, the Underground Railroad's efforts. What's more, there were also differences in the consequences and implications of their work if they were caught. Many white abolitionists would face fines or public shame depending on the community in which they were operating, but for most black abolitionists and escapees, everything was on the line. They could be returned to slavery, tortured, or even killed. It's worth homing in on one person who played a specifically noteworthy role in the operation. His name is William Still, and he came to be known by many as the father of the Underground Railroad. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. William Still was born in Burlington County, New Jersey in 1821 to Charity and Levin Still, both of whom were formerly enslaved. He was the youngest of 18 children. In 1847, William, who had moved to Philadelphia, was hired as a clerk for the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery. And when abolitionists in Philadelphia organized a vigilance committee to provide assistance to escape slaves, Still became the chairman of the group and a leader of Philadelphia's black community. He and his wife Letitia moved into a row house that would become a well-known station on the Underground Railroad. During his abolitionist work in Philadelphia, William Still helped nearly 800 enslaved people escape to freedom. But don't get lost in the numbers. Each of these people had a face, a name, a story. And each of those stories was one that Still believed was worth preserving. So what he did was interview those individuals who escaped as they passed through Philadelphia, and he kept meticulous records about where they were coming from and where they were going. He knew that such a detailed record could help reunite families who were separated under slavery. These records eventually became a book published in 1872, known as the Underground Railroad Records, which chronicles the stories of 649 enslaved people who escaped to freedom. To this day, it remains an invaluable resource for scholars in helping understand the context and methods of the people who escaped the claws of slavery. And reportedly, Still himself said, quote, ""...the heroism and desperate struggle that many of our people had to endure should be kept green in the memory of this and coming generations."" Thanks Thought Bubble. Another thing I believed when I was younger was that millions of enslaved people escaped through the Underground Railroad to freedom. But that's not really true. Historians still debate the actual number, but the historian Eric Foner estimates that between 1830 and 1860, some 30,000 fugitives were at some stage part of the Underground Railroad. But other scholars believe that the number was closer to 50,000. And some think it was twice that many. So compared to the millions of people who were enslaved throughout America's history, tens of thousands doesn't seem like that much. And to be clear, it's not to say that their lives don't matter, or that their success in finding some semblance of freedom should be taken for granted. Even just one person finding freedom is meaningful. But at the same time, we shouldn't delude ourselves into thinking that huge percentages of enslaved people escaped, because that simply isn't true. This is important because sometimes that myth can be used to mitigate our collective discomfort around this country's history of slavery. If we can convince ourselves that so many people escaped, then maybe it will let us feel a little bit less horrible about what happened here. But we can't let that be the case. We have to sit with the discomfort, and the existence of the Underground Railroad can't be used as a way to run from that. Additionally, what was in some ways just as important as the actual number of enslaved people who escaped is the symbolism of what the Underground Railroad represented. It was something that represented hope and possibility for many enslaved people, and also something that instilled an enormous amount of fear in enslavers. I mean, these are many of the same people who believed in Samuel Cartwright's bizarre contention that black people who wanted to run away were actually suffering from a disease, something he called drapetomania. Cartwright mentions two potential treatments for the disease, treating one's slaves kindly but firmly, or failing that, quote, whipping the devil out of them. The Underground Railroad is actually one of the reasons that many southern states were so adamant about passing the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, so that even if their enslaved property escaped to the north, these northern states would, by law, be required to assist the slave catchers and slaveholders in recapturing the escapees. If they didn't, there would be a significant fine. What's more, the way the judicial system was set up at the time made it so that the commissioners were incentivized to side with the slave catchers, because they were paid $10 for a decision that confirmed the black person as escaped property, and only $5 for a ruling that stated a given suspect was free. Another really important part of the story of the Underground Railroad is that while it focuses on people escaping to the north, the majority of enslaved people who attempted to escape actually did so by escaping to the Caribbean, Spanish Florida, Native American communities in the Southeast United States, free black communities in the Upper South, and Mexico. In 1829, Mexican President Vicente Guerrero, who was himself of mixed European, Native American, and African ancestry, abolished slavery in the country. Subsequently, many enslaved people who lived near the U.S.-Mexico border sought their freedom in America's neighbor to the south. Altogether, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Catherine Schultz argues that those groups of people combined likely outnumber the people who escaped to either northern free states or Canada. I think there's another important thing to say here, and it's that when I was younger, I silently wondered why every enslaved person couldn't simply escape slavery if they didn't want to be enslaved. I heard the stories of the Underground Railroad. I heard the stories of people like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, or even Henry Box Brown, who actually snuck into a crate and shipped himself to freedom on a 27-hour long trip from Richmond, Virginia to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I heard these stories and I found myself angered by the idea of those who didn't escape. Had they not tried hard enough? Didn't they care enough to do something? Did they choose to remain enslaved? On the one hand, it's deeply important to learn about enslaved people who escaped. At the same time, sometimes we can unintentionally lift up only the stories of exceptional people or exceptional acts in ways that implicitly blame those who cannot, despite the most brutal of circumstances, attain such superhuman heights. And sometimes, this can take away a focus from blaming the system, the people who built it, and the people who maintained it. There were other brilliant, exceptional people who lived under slavery, and many resisted the institution in innumerable ways. But our country's teachings about slavery, painfully limited, often focus singularly on heroic slave narratives and underground railroad stories of daring escapes, at the expense of the millions of men and women whose stories might be less sensational, but are no less worthy of being told. The vast majority of enslaved people did not escape. But that doesn't mean they didn't want to. It means that they were part of a system that threatened them with violence if they did, that threatened their family, friends, and community with violence if they tried, and in which the specter of violence and separation hung over everything they did. But as we've talked about, resistance to slavery does not only include slave uprisings and escapes. It is the millions of small moments in which someone reclaims agency for themselves amid an institution that is constantly attempting to take that away. The Underground Railroad is one example of how enslaved people tried to find their freedom. But it is not the only way. Far from it. Thanks for watching, I'll see you next time.

23f3fb60-82c0-4267-a852-fa2c3f75e507,"Hey there, I'm Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash Course Theater, and today we'll be looking at the surviving literature of Roman drama. Because Roman life wasn't all naval battles, naked miming prostitutes, and Christians being eaten by lions. Sometimes, you had to take a break and go watch a play. Much like Roman deities, the most popular form of Roman drama were comedies that borrow heavily from Greek originals, especially the comedies of Menander, with a little bit of Attilan farce thrown into the mix. These comedies are called fabulae paliatae. They have outdoor, urban settings, and are filled with stock characters. The hero of the play is typically a type known as the adulas case, a young man who is in love with the girl next door, the virgo, whom he can't marry because she's of dubious parentage, or he's in love with a prostitute, the miratrix. Then there's the senex, usually the father or the old man, who's either a strict miser or a loose skirt chaser. Other characters are the servus, the wily slave, the leno, the pimp, the miles gloriosus, the bragging soldier, and the parasite, a slave character who sponges off of his master. Sometimes wives and maidservants appear too. These stock characters get themselves involved in stock plots, often a couple plots per play. Most of the ones involve thwarted lovers, disagreement between parent and child, and mistaken identity, which is way easier to pull off when everyone is wearing masks. Sometimes there's a direct address to the audience too, kind of like a parabasis, and almost always there's a happy ending, at least for the lovers. Comedies with happy endings are Yorick's faves. He is a man of infinite jest, after all. Oh, sorry, was a man of infinite jest. In the Roman plays, most of the people and settings have Greek names, which is either a hat-tip to the original source or a real failure of imagination on the part of these writers. But even though the setting is ostensibly Greek, the situations and jokes about current events and even the street names are definitely Roman, especially in the works of Plautus. Plautus and Terence are the two guys we're going to be talking the most about. Why them? Well, partially because they were the greatest practitioners of Roman comedy, but also because, you guessed it, their plays survived. Titus Machias Plautus was born in 254 BCE in Umbria, a landlocked region with a lot of truffles. Legend has it that he worked as a stagehand in his hometown and then failed as a merchant before moving to Rome to write plays. 130 plays are attributed to him, but take that with a grain of Roman salt, a lot of writers tried to pass their plays off as his. A 1st century BCE scholar determined that 20 plays are definitely his, and get this, all 20 survive. More or less. It's fine, I'll take it. Plautus's plays are rambunctious comedies about middle class people and their slaves. You could even call them musicals, because from the meter they're written in, we know that at least half of each play was sung. He was a big influence on medieval and renaissance writers, Moliere was a fan, and we'll see that Shakespeare borrowed most of the comedy of errors from him. People love Plautus because his plays are energetic and uproarious, with puns galore and tip-top alliterations that are tricky to translate. Plautus's works are a lot like real life, with more prostitutes and twins and songs, which is to say, I guess, that they're not like real life at all. But they are a hoot. When he died in 184 BCE, he apparently wrote his own epitaph. After Plautus died, comedy mourns. The stage is deserted, and then laughter, mirth, and jest all wept in company. Okay, now tell us how you really feel about yourself. The other major comic playwright was Publius Terentius Afer, aka Terence, who's possibly the first playwright of color. Terence was born around the late 180s or early 190s BCE in Africa at Carthage, in a spot that's now a Tunisian suburb. He was a slave owned by a Roman senator who educated him and then freed him. He came to Rome to try to break into the theater by surprising a famous poet at his house. The poet was not thrilled, but then Terence began to read his play, and suddenly the poet was totally into it. Don't take too many lessons from this, though. I didn't get this job by showing up on Stan's doorstep with a stack of things to explain. It's not a great plan. Terence wrote six plays, which borrowed heavily from Menander. Cicero even called him a pint-sized Menander. After the sixth, he decided that he needed to travel more to write better plays, so at the age of 25, he left Athens and died at sea. His style is more sophisticated than Plautus's. The comedy is a little less rowdy, but the ironies are deeper. The characters are saner, the meter is more regular, and the constructions are sturdier. Fewer plot holes, fewer dirty jokes, some really elegant Latin. And the women aren't treated that badly, so that's nice. These are classier plays, but they're maybe not as funny. And hey, one more difference. In Plautus and Menander, the prologue basically tells you what's going to happen. Terence doesn't do that. He creates suspense. To take a closer look at Roman comedy, we're going to check out one of Plautus's plays, The Monochmy, or The Monochmoose Twins, which we selected because Shakespeare borrowed most of it for The Comedy of Errors. The Monochmy begins with a prologue addressed directly to the audience. An actor comes out and tells everyone, hey, listen up, this is Plautus. You love Plautus. Give it up. Give it up for our man Plautus. The prologue tells us that once there was a merchant from Syracuse who had identical twin sons. He took one of those sons to Epidamnus, where the son was kidnapped, and the merchant died of a broken heart. Both boys eventually end up being called Monochmoose, which is a little weird, but hey, you do you. For simplicity, we're going to call them M in the Thought Bubble. Years after their poorly-fated trip, Syracuse M comes to Epidamnus, searching for his brother Epidamnus M. Epidamnus M is infatuated with a prostitute, Erotium, a name that basically means sexy. He keeps giving her all of his wife's stuff, which, understandably, makes his wife mad. Epidamnus M and his parasite servant go to visit Erotium. He gives her one of his wife's dresses and tells her to prepare a feast, and then he goes away. Syracuse M comes in, gets mistaken for Epidamnus M, and gets to eat Erotium's feast. And he's all, this place is rad. But somehow it never occurs to him that maybe he's been mistaken for the identical twin brother he's been searching for for six years? Yeah. There are some plot holes. After the feast, Erotium gives Syracuse M the dress and tells him to take it to the tailor. Meanwhile, Epidamnus M's wife is like, why do you keep giving all of my dresses to your prostitute? So he tries to get it back from Erotium, and she's like, dude, I just gave it to you. Then his wife sees Syracuse M and mistakes him for her husband. He doesn't recognize her, so she tries to have him arrested for craziness and maybe dress stealing. And then Epidamnus M enters, and the two identical brothers see each other, but it still doesn't occur to Syracuse M that this is the brother he's been looking for. Luckily, the smart servant figures it out, the brothers are reunited, and Epidamnus M decides to auction off all of his stuff, including his wife, so he can return with his brother to Syracuse. Thanks, Thought Bubble. So yeah, it's absurd, sexist, heavily reliant on stock characters and stock situations, but still… funny? Not all of Roman drama is quite so hilarious, though. Take the work of Seneca the Younger, please. Haha, just a little comedy comedy for you there. Seneca Jr. is born Lucius Aeneas Seneca in what is modern-day Cordoba, Spain, in 4 BCE. That's just a little while after Horace publishes the Ars Poetica, the first major work since Aristotle's Poetics to tell people what plays should be. Seneca's dad was a big deal rhetorician, and when he was young, he was moved to Rome to study Stoic philosophy, because there's nothing the kids like more than Stoicism. He came to adulthood during a pretty volatile time in Roman history. Little Seneca, who grew up to be another big deal rhetoric guy, kept running afoul of emperors, which was easy to do because a lot of them were dangerous psychopaths. Caligula almost executed Seneca, then Claudius banished Seneca on the grounds of adultery. Claudius' wife called him back and installed him as a tutor for Nero, who became emperor, and kept Seneca on as a counselor. But then Nero went a little crazy, and even though Seneca was retired, Nero blamed him for taking part in a conspiracy and ordered him to kill himself. So Seneca did. Man, Stoics. When Seneca wasn't being threatened by emperors, he sometimes wrote plays, which are mostly revisions of classic Greek works, and they're all tragedies. One possible exception is his Apocalypse Sentosus, a satire about the emperor Claudius that no one really likes, and which maybe he didn't even write. In general, Roman tragedies based on Greek subjects are known as fabulae crepidatae, and there were lots, 300 years worth, but basically Seneca's are the only ones that survived. Seneca's tragedies are notable because they're the first to favor the five-act structure that Shakespeare would adopt. They have a different relationship to the divine, with a lot less confidence that the gods are going to help everything work out, which is to say they're pretty dark. It makes sense when you remember all of the scary, violent emperors who were ruling Rome during Seneca's time. Nero was as merciless and arbitrary as even the most capricious god. And remember all that stuff the Greeks liked to keep offstage? Like say, really extreme and incredibly gory violence? That's just the kind of thing Seneca wants to show. Because atrocities, especially those perpetrated on the weak by the powerful, were facts of life in his society. And also a regular feature in violent entertainments like gladiator fights. So if you've ever thought, hey, I'd really like to see Oedipus blind himself and maybe he could actually tear out both of his eyeballs, man, I have got a play for you. But not you. You don't have eyes. Because of scenes like that one, and the fact that Seneca was a high class kind of person, there's been a lot of debate about whether his plays were actually performed, or whether they were closet dramas meant to be read rather than produced. Certainly some of the scenes, like the cannibal meal in Thaestes, would have required special effects, but let's not put some creepy props or even extreme violence beyond the limits of the Roman stage. Remember, these are the people who thought that a group of dwarves beating a woman with spiked clubs was just normal entertainment. Check us out next time for a survey of ancient Sanskrit theater.

61615e08-add8-481b-8b96-acd938e8d56f,"Hi, I'm Clint Smith, and this is Crash Course Black American History. At the start of the Reconstruction Era, the country had been at war for four years and over 700,000 people had lost their lives. In 1865, 700,000 lives was roughly 2% of the entire population of the country. 2% of the current U.S. population is over 6 million people. It's a staggering amount of death. And after all of that death and destruction, the U.S. had to figure out a way to put itself back together. It had to grapple with what it meant for the United States to be a country in which black people were not enslaved. Something that the country had quite literally never encountered before. This was new territory. After generations upon generations upon generations of chattel slavery, black folks were free. But what would that freedom look like? Would they be given the tools, the skills, the education, and the resources to turn this freedom into something? Or would this freedom have an asterisk by it? Let's find out. In short, Reconstruction was a period following the Civil War that lasted from 1865 to 1877. Though some scholars argue it began in 1863 with the Emancipation Proclamation. During this time, the country was attempting to remake itself through a series of provisions, programs, and amendments that were ostensibly meant to ensure that black people had civil rights. But this was easier said than done. You have to remember that just because the Confederates lost the war on the battlefield doesn't mean that their opinions changed about who black people were and where they belonged in the social hierarchy. W.E.B. Du Bois described this period as a moment where, quote, the slave went free, stood a brief moment in the sun, then moved back again towards slavery. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. In the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, there was a glimmer of hope for what a new, more egalitarian society might look like. Black people in the South had the federal government on their side. And the idea was that the federal government would intervene to ensure that black Americans could transition into life as citizens as safely and efficiently as possible. The thing is, emancipation fundamentally restructured Southern life for both freed people and white Southerners. The former planters and enslavers lost their source of labor and sometimes even their land. During the Civil War, Union General William T. Sherman's March to the Sea, a 285-mile trek through Georgia from Atlanta to Savannah, left a large portion of the state burned to the ground and devastated by his scorched earth, total war approach. Planters and Confederate soldiers fled during the rampage, leaving a lot of land empty and untended. Sherman intended to parcel out this land to formerly enslaved people in Sherman's Field Order No. 15. This is where the famous 40 acres and a mule idea came from, though mules weren't initially part of it. Sherman believed that redistributing the land was important because it both punished Confederate landowners for their role in starting and sustaining the Civil War, while also providing newly freed black people with the land and resources they needed to begin a new life in this post-emancipation South. Thanks Thought Bubble. Five days after Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox, effectively ending the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's vice president, a Democrat, and a former enslaver, became the new president. Johnson believed the opposite of what General Sherman proposed. Instead of taking land from former Confederates and giving it to the freedmen, Johnson believed in pardoning Confederates, lending them back into the Union and into government without asking them for basically anything. Johnson's views were at odds with Congress, which following the election of 1866 was controlled by the Republicans, who were at that time the party of the left, and who had a large enough majority to pass legislation and even override Johnson's veto. These radical Republicans, as they were known, led by Thaddeus Stevens, even impeached Johnson, though he avoided conviction by a single vote in the Senate. The Reconstruction Amendments, the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution were passed to establish black Americans' legal protections. The 13th Amendment of 1865 formally abolished slavery across the whole of the United States. Many people get this confused with the Emancipation Proclamation. But the Proclamation, if you remember, only freed enslaved people in the rebelling states. However, it's important to note a particular clause in the 13th Amendment. The legislation reads, Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, shall exist within the United States. And in fact, unpaid and underpaid labor remains a frequently criticized aspect of mass incarceration today. The 14th Amendment was adopted in 1868 and addressed citizenship. It reads, All persons born or naturalized in the United States are citizens of the United States. It also says, No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the rights of citizens of the United States, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. It seems pretty straightforward on paper. But this amendment has not always been equally enforced. To say the least, black people's rights were definitely abridged over time. And in many places, these rights were completely and violently subverted. Last but not least, the 15th Amendment, passed in 1870. This one gave black men, though not women, the right to vote. It reads, The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. In order to enforce the Three Amendments and protect black people's rights, the Freedmen's Bureau, a coalition of Northern officials and Union soldiers, was set up throughout the South. Many Southern states hated the idea of formerly enslaved people having these rights. And having federal troops down there seemed like the only way to make sure these rights were protected. The Freedmen's Bureau was tasked with helping newly freed black people make a life for themselves. And they had a few ways of doing this. They legally recognized marriages between formerly enslaved people. Before, many enslaved people would have unofficial ceremonies. So actions like jumping the broom would be the only signifiers of lifelong commitment. Now as citizens, states would recognize their marriage. Additionally, the Bureau helped to reunite families who had been separated during slavery, which over the course of 250 years had split apart millions of people. So post-emancipation, the Bureau took testimonies of enslaved people and checked records of relocated individuals to bring families back together. But in one of its main roles, securing work contracts, the Bureau proved to be… not so great. Many black Americans were forced into contracts to become sharecroppers or tenant farmers. Which is to say, they would grow crops for a landowner in exchange for room and board. And while they were allowed to keep some of their crops for themselves, technically they weren't paid a wage or salary for their work. And many of them were pushed right back into the clutches of the enslavers they had seemingly just escaped. Additionally, the Freedmen's Savings Bank, which was ostensibly created to help the formerly enslaved after emancipation, shut down within less than a decade, and the money of tens of thousands of depositors, equaling nearly $3 million, essentially disappeared. More than half of the accumulated black wealth by 1874 disappeared through the mismanagement of the Freedmen's Savings Bank. Just… gone. Still, the Bureau did a pretty good job in assisting black Americans with their pursuit of formal education, something that black people had been advocating as central to the possibility of upward mobility. Historian James D. Anderson argues that the freed slaves were the first Southerners to campaign for universal, state-supported public education. The Freedmen's Bureau set up schools for black people of all ages, according to historian James McPherson, by 1870, there were more than 1,000 schools for freedmen in the South. Bureau initiatives also allowed African Americans to gain political power. An important outgrowth of the 15th Amendment was an influential black voting bloc that translated into real political power. In the years following the Civil War, leading to the turn of the century, 22 black people were elected to Congress, two of which were Senators, Hiram Revels and Blanche Kelso Bruce from Mississippi. And it wasn't just nationally. Black people were voted into office in state legislatures across the South. According to McPherson, at the beginning of 1867, no African Americans in the South held political office. But within just a few years, about 15% of officeholders in the South were black, a larger proportion than in 1990. Many of these newly elected black politicians had been soldiers in the Union Army. According to historian Eric Foner, for black soldiers, military service meant more than the opportunity to help save the Union, more even than their freedom and the destruction of slavery as an institution. For men of talent and ambition, the Army flung open the door to advancement and respectability. One of the main subjects of conversation among new black politicians surrounded the 14th and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and whether there was room for women in politics. According to historian Martha Jones, black women moved in from the margins during this debate. They insisted that an intersectional analysis, one that simultaneously took up race and gender, was required if organizations such as the Equal Rights Association expected to move forward in the post-emancipation era. It was clear that black women existing at, in Jones' words, the nexus of sex and color, had a unique perspective and set of experiences that were making clear that black freedom should include freedom for all black people, not just the men. As black education and political power flourished in the late 1860s and early 1870s, African Americans faced white supremacist opposition. Much of this violence was tied to the formation of the Ku Klux Klan, led by former Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, who served as the first Grand Wizard of the organization from 1867 to 1869, before Ulysses S. Grant led an effort that largely wiped them out by 1872, at least temporarily. And even though the organization of the Klan was gone for the moment, violence against black people was still growing. The presidential election of 1876 was tenuous. President Samuel Tilden of New York earned 184 electoral votes, which was one less than required. Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio got 165. However, election results in Louisiana, Florida, and South Carolina were disputed. Alongside an elector issue in Oregon, these 20 electoral votes would decide the election. In what became known as the Compromise of 1877, Hayes was elected president on the condition that the remaining Union soldiers would be withdrawn from the South. This meant that there was no more federal protection for black Americans in the South. Millions of black people now felt completely and thoroughly abandoned. By the end of the 19th century, 2,500 black people would be lynched throughout the South, more than 100 black men and women per year. Sometimes people say that Reconstruction failed, but it would be more accurate to say that it was violently overthrown. It did not fail to succeed because black people were incapable of governance, as some 20th century historians and famous films like The Birth of a Nation seem to suggest. It failed to succeed because white Southerners did everything they could to thwart black mobility and opportunity. The U.S. could have gone in a different direction. It could have provided land, resources, and opportunity to millions of black people to begin to build a life for themselves after 250 years of bondage. Some resources that would have at least attempted to account for the generations of exploitation that black people suffered in this country. But a different choice was made, and we are still feeling the impact of that today. Thanks for watching, I'll see you next time.

ccc65c95-843c-4b04-8ac5-649f5c77c056,"Hi there, I'm Clint Smith, and I'm the host of Crash Course Black American History. I'm a writer, a teacher, and a doctor. No, not the kind who can help you if you have some sort of serious medical issue. More like the kind who spent way too many years holed up in the basement of the library reading books on race, inequality, education, and history before getting the letters PhD behind my name. So, while I can't perform open-heart surgery, I can tell you a lot about how slavery shaped the course of American history and the ways it's been taught in our schools. This series will move from the moment enslaved black people first arrived on the shores of the American-British colonies in 1619, all the way through the Black Lives Matter movement that has pushed this country to more fully reckon with all that it has done to black people and to more fully acknowledge all that black Americans have contributed to its history. We should probably begin by addressing the name of the course itself, Black American History. Through the course of American history, the language used to describe black people has changed and evolved over time, and will no doubt continue to change and evolve moving forward. Across the United States today, the term black and African American are often used interchangeably, and there's a good chance that we'll use them interchangeably here as well. Typically, African American is meant to refer to people of African descent who were born in or are living in the United States. In the U.S., there are black people whose ancestors were enslaved many generations ago, and who are unable to trace their lineage to a specific place of origin. And there are black people who immigrated to the United States just a few years ago, from countries all over the world. While people's histories and experiences may be different, each of these groups of people, and everyone in between, is black. And that plurality of experiences is both a remarkable and just a beautiful thing, as people discover there's a great deal of fluidity with regard to how these terms are used and who they apply to. And delving into this will really help us understand how race is a social construct, but also one that has very real cultural, sociological, and political implications. Part of why this show is so important to me personally is that when I was younger, I felt like I didn't have the language or the toolkit with which to fully understand and make sense of what this country had done to black people over the course of centuries. I didn't know that 12 of our first 18 presidents owned enslaved people. I didn't have the language to understand how redlining and government-sponsored housing segregation shaped the landscape of contemporary America. I didn't know that New Deal legislation and the GI Bill after World War II purposely left out millions of black people from accessing its benefits, basically trapping them in intergenerational poverty. I didn't know how millions of white Americans received those benefits, giving them a leg up into purchasing homes, attending and graduating college, and moving comfortably into the middle class. The sorts of things that have long-term intergenerational implications. I didn't know these things because no one told me. No one taught us this in school. And when I did learn it, many years later, it was so important. It was so freeing because it helped me better understand why our country looks the way that it does today. It helped me understand that the disparities black people experience in this country are not because there is anything wrong with black people, but because of everything that has been done to black people over the course of generations. Now it should be said that sometimes when people think about black history, they think only of slavery and oppression. And while slavery is deeply, deeply important, trust me, I wrote a whole book about it, to understanding how black Americans first arrived here en masse, how the United States developed its early economy, and why so much inequality persists between black and white Americans across the board. It would also be a mistake to conflate the story of black life in this country singularly with the issue of slavery. Which is to say, naming the centrality of slavery to the American project can be done without falling into the trap of suggesting that black history begins and ends with slavery. Black history is more than slavery, it is more than Jim Crow apartheid, it is more than oppression. And while we will obviously be addressing these issues directly, because they are central to understanding how this country came to be what it is, we will also be talking about black art, black literature, black cultural traditions, and all that black people have created and accomplished in spite of centuries of both interpersonal and structural violence. Black American history is as much about the joys and celebrations and traditions of black life as much as it is about being able to name and identify the ways that this country has long subjugated black people. They are not and have never been mutually exclusive. In fact, they go hand in hand. That being said, we want to note that this series will address topics that can be challenging to discuss, but we believe it is important to cover them thoroughly so that we can fully grapple with the reality of U.S. history. When watching this course, you will encounter some information that may be sensitive and disturbing, but we will also try to let you know when there are extreme cases. Over the course of this show, we will do our very best to capture the various dimensions of the black experience. But because we only have 50 episodes to tell these stories, there will inevitably be some things that are left out. This show is not at all meant to be a definitive history of black American life, it is meant to be just one contribution to a much wider conversation that has been happening among scholars, writers, activists, and citizens for generations. There's going to be a lot to learn over the course of this show, and a lot to unlearn. But what we hope you come to understand is that black history is not peripheral to American history, it is central to it. Black history is American history. So let's go.

29bf4afb-4f13-4de4-aedf-1269d446aff4,"What makes someone an entrepreneur? Am I an entrepreneur? Are you an entrepreneur? Do I know any entrepreneurs? Is it genetic? Can I catch it? Is it fatal? Wait, what? The word entrepreneur seems to be thrown around everywhere, for everyone, doing anything. It's used to describe celebrities and business tycoons like Beyonce, Elon Musk, Marie Kondo, and Jessica Alba. But your brother who keeps bringing up his idea for coffee-flavored toothpaste might make the list, too. Entrepreneurs pop up in all types of industries and can have widely different backgrounds. Some build personal brands, while others work tirelessly on a physical product that they believe in. Really, anyone can be an entrepreneur, given an idea and the right tools to develop it into a functional business. Together, we'll develop our business acumen and learn the importance of grit, determination, and a fair bit of luck. I'm Anna Akana, and this is Crash Course Business Entrepreneurship. INTRO Some people define an entrepreneur with buzzwords like trailblazing, innovative, problem-solving, passionate, and on and on. These might all be traits that entrepreneurs can strive for. But at its core, an entrepreneur is someone who sees a need and takes on the financial risk to start a business to fill that need. That may sound kind of vague, but that's kind of the point. There is no cookie-cutter entrepreneur. Unless you, like, start a business to sell cookie cutters, in which case, yes, there is a cookie-cutter entrepreneur. Your idea might take the form of a physical product in a physical store, called a brick-and-mortar business. In Montana, Charlie and Barbie Beaton of Big Dipper Ice Cream took their passion for locally-made ice cream from one shop in downtown Missoula to appearing on Good Morning America. Or, instead of a tangible product, your venture might be a national empowerment network. Girlboss New Zealand was founded by 20-year-old Alexia Hilbertidou after she was the only woman in her upper-level physics class. Her goal is encouraging high school-age women to pursue STEM and leadership careers. Or you might set your sights on an international online media empire, like Ariana Huffington, the founder and namesake of HuffPost. She founded her site with partners as a friendly alternative to news aggregators, and she eventually sold it to AOL in 2015 for $315 million US dollars. Get it, Ari? It's clear that entrepreneurs come in all flavors. I mean, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, over 100 million businesses are launched each year. That is 11,000 per hour, or three new businesses per second. There they go. So instead of just defining who is an entrepreneur, since it is such a wide scope, we can instead narrow down our definition by understanding who is not one. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. Say Congress works for MeWow, a feline health and fitness company. He notices a need, a shocking lack of cat transportation, and comes up with the idea for the Cat Cycle, which he pitches to his boss. MeWow immediately sends the Cat Cycle into production, because it's a genius idea, Avi, and it flies off the shelves. Even though Congress is using an entrepreneurial mindset, by our definition, he isn't an entrepreneur yet. The company, MeWow, actually took the financial risk to develop, produce, and sell the Cat Cycle. Meanwhile, Beetle sees the same need for cat transportation and sketches out the Cat Board in his personal idea notebook after work. He's gained valuable experience working for MeWow and develops the Cat Board in the evenings and on weekends before striking out on his own. Using his personal savings, Beetle commissions a prototype that he shops around to local stores. A few are interested, and he sets up contracts with them. As his sales begin to grow, Beetle creates new designs, but he doesn't pay attention to what his customers like or dislike about the Cat Board. Because he failed to make valuable improvements to the Cat Board for his customers, sales plummet. It's a tough decision, but Beetle cuts his losses and sells his Cat Board designs to MeWow, which revamps his idea as the Dog Board. Beetle is an entrepreneur because he saw a need and took the financial risk to fill it. It didn't go so well because he didn't incorporate customer feedback, but now he knows where he went wrong and won't make the same mistake in his next entrepreneurial endeavor. Thanks, Thought Bubble! For a while, the classic story of an entrepreneur was someone who created one business that became a long-term project, like opening a new restaurant or founding a tech startup to make flashy phone games. But that is not the whole picture anymore. There has been a shift in the global job market that has opened the door for entrepreneurship to become more mainstream. Specifically, I'm talking about the rise of the gig economy. Contract work, called gigging, is becoming more popular and taking up more of the labor market. And I don't just mean gigs like musicians and comedians hopping between open mic nights. Instead of a long-term relationship where employees are paid salaries by the hour or year, businesses are temporarily hiring people for specific projects. This shift has made it financially easier for entrepreneurs to find people to get their businesses going without committing long-term to paying employees. And it's allowed early-stage entrepreneurs to find flexible work to support themselves as they develop their product or service. This doesn't mean everyone in the gig economy is an entrepreneur. It's just given more people the opportunity. So a more traditional path might be joining an accounting firm right after college and working 9 to 5, Monday to Friday, until you retire or die of boredom. Spreadsheets for life? No thank you. Some people might feel fulfilled with that kind of steady employment. And the stability that comes from being a salaried employee with health insurance can be incredibly valuable. Others, like us entrepreneurs, might itch for more independence. In the gig economy, you can have a couple of ways to make money in addition to or instead of that 9 to 5 job. And you can go online to look for gigs from anywhere, not just your real-life community. So you might consult for a network of women small business owners on their day-to-day accounting, create vlogs with tax software tips, or sell unicorn hats on Etsy that are knit out of the softest fabric there is. On the plus side, this allows workers to build robust portfolios of work and find fulfilling gigs. Having separate jobs can also provide a stronger sense of income security than one full-time job. Even if you lose one, you're still making money. All hail the side hustle. Today's entrepreneurs are well-suited for the gig economy because we know how to hustle. We're independent thinkers who are comfortable with developing our own diverse income streams, marketing ourselves, and connecting with others. I mean, who has not had a Lyft driver who moonlights as a cinnamon roll artisan, right? But there are still problems with the gig lifestyle. Sure, someone might become a Lyft driver to help fund their sugary dream, but they're almost certainly not doing it because driving strangers around is their passion. For some people, participating in the gig economy is a necessity, not a choice. Scrambling to pay rent and afford food is another reason to have a bunch of gigs. And, depending on the country and government, gig workers can have fewer legal protections, like mandatory breaks and standardized pay, or they might have a harder time maintaining insurance and retirement accounts. This makes some countries more attractive to entrepreneurs, such as New Zealand, Singapore, and Denmark, based on the World Bank's annual analysis of the ease of doing business. But even in those countries, there's a difference between legally being able to take a break and actually taking a break. It can be a struggle to turn off the hustle, especially for those of us trying to create a personal brand with our art or online presence. But taking time for fun hobbies and spending time with your friends and family are very important parts of being successful and so necessary to staying mentally healthy. Trust me. So it's not all blue skies and rainbows, but if you ever wanted to be an entrepreneur, the gig economy has made it more possible now than ever. Even still, entrepreneurship is not easy. Taking a financial gamble is stressful, and so is working long hours to try and get a project off the ground. I know for me, the lack of structured work time often means that my business has no off time at all. And if I'm not careful, I can just work myself around the clock and get very exhausted. But tons of us take the leap to start a new business and stick with it through the ups and the downs. So what exactly keeps us motivated through those downs? At the top of the list is freedom. Entrepreneurs get to be their own bosses. This can mean setting your own hours, deciding on your dress code, or the lack of. I mean, sweatpants all day every day, am I right? I mean, maybe you want to work from bed or while you travel, writing emails by the pool. And for traditionally underrepresented groups in business, like women, people of color, or the LGBTQ plus community, ding, ding, ding, I'm all those things, it can mean defining your own destiny. You can create an inclusive company culture and work environment, rather than feeling stuck in an uncomfortable or even possibly illegal situation with a boss or co-worker. If someone keeps talking over you and dismissively says women can't be funny, you don't need to hire them for your writer's room or film set. Or if a co-worker from a previous job got fired for having a natural hairstyle, you can create a business where that would never happen. You wield the power. A study in the Social Science Research Network journal found that entrepreneurs start companies because they mostly believe that 1. They are inherently more valuable than how they appear on paper. 2. They are wasted working for someone else. 3. Their resumes don't show the real them. 4. Large companies can't appreciate their full potential. And finally, they are capable of turning their internal value into real-life money. Basically, entrepreneurs believe in themselves. And sure, building self-confidence over time isn't always easy, but it can be a powerful motivator. And then there's potential wealth. Yes, there is financial risk in starting a business, but there is money in running a successful one. Entrepreneurial lore is full of rags-to-riches tales, where people pitch the next Snapchat and are launched into the business stratosphere. Like Oprah Winfrey has said, she spent her early childhood wearing overalls made of potato sacks. But she became North America's first black multi-billionaire and queen of the daytime talk show. Sure, this is the stuff of inspirational posters, and not everyone can make it this big. But entrepreneurship does create a culture of opportunity that might work for some non-traditional workers. Of course, every entrepreneur with a massive success has also had hundreds of failures. Yeah, I know, the dreaded F-word. Lean Startup Methodology is basically the globally recognized guidebook for entrepreneurs created by Steve Blank and Eric Ries. And it says that stumbling is perfectly fine if we learn as we go. But to identify and learn from failures, every entrepreneur has to ask themselves, what does success look like to me? Is it earning $30,000 a year in your food truck and skiing every weekend? Is it selling your idea for a million dollars? Is it becoming the CEO of a mid-sized media production company and writing novels on the side? Thanks for hiring us, Hank. Also, where is the sequel and when can I star in the movie adaptation? Or is it owning six cats and producing your own films? Whatever success is, it's entirely up to you. Of course, no one wants to fail, but together we'll learn how to redefine failure and pick up the pieces if it's truly unavoidable. It's not that successful entrepreneurs never faced failure, it's that they didn't quit. So the bottom line is, anyone can be an entrepreneur with a little grit, determination, and luck. And remember, you may have stopped believing in unicorns, but they've never stopped believing in you. Next time, we'll talk about that fundamental piece at the core of any entrepreneur, their ideas. Where ideas come from, who to take them to, and how to turn them into feasible businesses.

fb54c2cd-99c8-4076-befd-f35ef229c53a,"Hi, I'm John Green, and this is Crash Course Literature. Today we're going to continue our discussion of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, a book that reads like it was written by your funny and mean best friend, who also happens to be a brilliant novelist and a pretty interesting moral philosopher. I mean, I love my best friend, but I really wish Jane Austen was my best friend, although due to our linear experience of time, I suppose that's impossible. And also, let's face it, she wouldn't have been that into me. So last time we talked about the political and historical context of the novel, and how to choose between your personal fulfillment and the good of your family. Today we're going to look at whether the book is an endorsement of materialism or a rejection of it. We'll also look at the politics of the novel itself, whether it's liberal or conservative in its outlook, and we'll enjoy some sexy, sexy landscape description. But first, let's consider the epistemological problems of the book. Because here at Crash Course, we know how to party. And also, we just learned the meaning of the word epistemological. INTRO Okay, so epistemology is the study of knowledge. It's knowing how we know and what it means to know. And knowledge is a real problem in Pride and Prejudice. Much of the plot hinges on what people know, and when they know it, and how they know they can be sure of their knowledge. I mean, you have to remember, this is Regency England. If you like someone, you can't, like, immediately Google them, or Snapchat them, or I have no idea what young people do. Compared to today's young people, I basically grew up in Regency England. So at the beginning of the novel, when Jane and Mr. Bingley meet, Jane has no way to let him know that she likes him. She can't just, like, swipe right or left. I really, I don't know. I don't know any of this stuff. I'm trying to sound young and hip and relatable, and I should just give up because I am one year younger than Jane Austen was when she died. I'm sorry, what were we talking about? Right, Jane has no way of letting Mr. Bingley know she likes him, and she also has no way of discovering just how available he is. Characters have to rely on gossip and subtle inquiries, sometimes in the form of letters and what they can see with their own eyes. But Austen is skeptical about whether you even can trust the evidence of your own eyes. I mean, when Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy see each other for the first time, they hate each other. And months go by before they learn enough about each other to readjust those initial impressions. Mr. Darcy's pride flourishes because he doesn't know or understand the people around him, and the same goes for Elizabeth's prejudice. And in addition to constantly reminding us how little we know of other people, Austen also investigates how little we know about ourselves. Elizabeth is the character that most of us will identify with in this novel. Austen wrote in a letter, I think her as delightful a character as ever appeared in print, and how I shall be able to tolerate those who do not like her, at least, I do not know. But even the exceptionally clever and relatable Elizabeth has to admit that she has been mistaken in most of her beliefs, particularly ones about herself. Once she learns the truth of the bad feelings between Darcy and Wickham, for instance, she has to acknowledge her own prejudices and even says, Till this moment, I never knew myself. And one of the most fascinating things that Austen does in this book is to put the reader into that place of not knowing. Like, take the scene in which Elizabeth watches Wickham, whom she likes, and Mr. Darcy, whom she despises, run into each other. At this point, she believes that Mr. Darcy has cheated Wickham of his inheritance. But when she sees them, she doesn't know what to believe. Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed color. One looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat, a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? I mean, not only do we not know why one turned white and one turned red, we don't even know who turned which color. Now, Elizabeth presumably knows, but by calling attention to what we as readers don't know, Austen is also reminding us of all that Elizabeth doesn't know, just how often she has to wonder what could be the meaning of it. And speaking of meaning, Pride and Prejudice spends a lot of time examining the meaning of money. Austen lets us know how much everyone has, where it comes from, how much they stand to inherit, and so on. Let's check everyone's accounts in the Thought Bubble. Mr. Bennett has 2,000 pounds per year, which just about puts him into the upper middle class. But because his estate is entailed and will be inherited by the nearest male relative when he and his wife die, his daughters will only have a share of what their mother brought into the marriage. Each daughter stands to inherit about 40 pounds a year. It's hard to estimate how much this is in today's money. It could be as little as a few thousand dollars, though, so definitely not enough to live comfortably. Mr. Bingley has at least 5,000 pounds per year, which is very nice. But Darcy has at least double that every year from rents on his land. He might make even more than that from the interest on his investments, so it's safe to think of him as kind of a multimillionaire. His sister Georgiana has an inheritance of 30,000 pounds, so even assuming a conservative investment, she'll be fine. Wickham inherited 1,000 pounds from Mr. Darcy's father, and then Mr. Darcy gave him 3,000 more when Wickham decided to quit the clergy. But he spent it all, so he'll need to marry rich. Obviously, Lydia isn't rich, but between paying his debts and buying his commission, Mr. Darcy gives Wickham another 1,500 pounds. Plus, he may have given him 10,000 more pounds in order to convince him to marry Lydia and avoid scandal. Thanks, Thought Bubble. So the real question here is whether the amount of money someone has indicates moral worth, which may seem like an answered question in 21st century investment banker America, but in 19th century England, things were a little different. For instance, Darcy is certainly richer than Wickham, and he's also morally superior. But there are a couple places in the novel that indicate that money definitely isn't everything. Like Mr. Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine, has plenty of money, but that doesn't stop her from being portrayed as a killjoy and a snob. And Austen satirizes her materialism to great effect, like the way Lady Catherine pays attention to how nice people's carriages are, or how Mr. Collins fawns over Lady Catherine and her daughter just because they're rich. But Austen also satirizes materialism in people who have much less money, like Wickham with his debts. And the book is pretty hard on Lydia, too, who can't afford to buy lunch for her sisters because she's spent all of her money on a disgusting hat, saying, Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty, but I thought I might as well buy it as not. Here Austen seems to be suggesting that how you spend money probably matters as much or more as how much of it you have. Quick side note, the growing industrialization of England meant that more artifacts were available to the average person. And when I say artifacts, I mean everything from, you know, pots and pans to clothing. Even a generation or two before, the middle class had been vastly smaller, and there weren't as many, like, materials to be materialistic about. So almost all people, almost all of the time, would have been buying lunch rather than buying bonnets. Maybe then money can actually chip away at personal happiness and moral character, but again, not exactly. The book is way too nuanced for that. Austen doesn't come out and say that you should marry for money, but the novel does seem to endorse the idea that the characters who acquire the most money do end up being the happiest. I think it's clearly implied that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are going to live happily ever after, and so will Jane and Mr. Bingley. Charlotte and Mr. Collins are only a little happy, because Mr. Collins is almost as horrible as Mary, but they'll probably be happier once Mr. Collins inherits. And it doesn't seem like Lydia and Wickham, who have the least, will be very happy at all. They don't even like each other by the time the book ends, and it's only Mr. Darcy's money that saved Lydia from total disgrace. And also, we need to remember how and why Elizabeth falls in love with Mr. Darcy. Part of it is the letter he sends her, and part of it has to do with how he rescues her sister, but a lot of it has to do with his estate, Pemberley. When Elizabeth first sees Pemberley, we get a rare passage of description in the book. It was a large, handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high, woody hills. And in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. And at that moment, she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something. Now obviously this is a stand-in for Mr. Darcy himself, who is also large and handsome and not artificial, but it's the revelation of this beautiful estate that really wins Elizabeth's heart, which suggests that Pemberley is not only a metaphor for Darcy, Darcy is also a metaphor for Pemberley. Now it's easy to argue that this is a conservative book. Everyone gets married in the end. Elizabeth gets to be both happy and rich. Mr. Darcy, an authoritarian figure who holds power over a lot of people, turns out to be the hero. And Wickham, the upstart who comes from the servant class, is the villain. So the established social hierarchy gets reaffirmed in terms of class, but also in terms of gender. Like Elizabeth, who seemed so free-thinking and independent-minded, is rewarded with marriage to a wealthy aristocrat who said that her looks were tolerable. But on the other hand, you could argue that the book is a lot more radical than that. Yes, Mr. Darcy makes Elizabeth happy, but arguing for her own individual happiness is a really progressive stance. Like when Lady Catherine tries to get Elizabeth to say that she'll never marry Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth replies, I am only resolved to act in that manner which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness. My own opinion. My happiness. Maybe that doesn't sound revolutionary, but I think it is. This book was written in a time when individual happiness was not privileged over family status and security. And that was especially true for the individual happiness of women. So Elizabeth saying that she would only act in a manner that would constitute her happiness is a claiming of full personhood with certain inalienable rights, including liberty and the pursuit of happiness. She's saying not only that her opinion matters, but that she gets to make the final decision in what she does, independent of what her family wants for her, which was another radical idea for women in Regency England. And the novel also suggests that Elizabeth's vivacity might have a beneficial effect on Mr. Darcy, hinting that it might be possible to work from within to change some of the older, more authoritarian systems. She's not wild or flighty or buying terrible bonnets like Lydia, but she is independently minded, and the fact that Mr. Darcy falls for her suggests that maybe he and men like him are capable of change. Now, this would be a darker and more radical novel if it actually made Elizabeth choose between happiness and financial security, instead of presenting all of that in Pemberley II, courtesy of Mr. Darcy. But it is no sin for a book to have a happy ending, and Pride and Prejudice is still a vindication of Elizabeth's character and temperament, and it makes a really persuasive argument for personal happiness as a moral category worth celebrating. So go forth and pursue some happiness for yourself. And thanks for watching.

47e7756f-e122-4489-aeef-e45d388abf25,"The world we live in feels normal, ordinary. It feels like this is just how humans exist and always existed. But it's not. Never before have we humans lived in a world as sophisticated and engineered to our needs as today, giving us the luxury to forget about ourselves and not worry about survival. Food, shelter, security, all of this is more or less taken for granted. But we're a special few. For more than 99.99% of human history, life was completely different. And there's no such thing as just one human history. Our story begins six million years ago, when the tribe of Hominini split and our relationship with the apes ended. 2.8 million years ago, the genus of Homo, the first humans emerged. We like to think of ourselves as the only humans, but this is far from the truth. When we, Homo sapiens sapiens, came into existence 200,000 years ago, there were at least six other human species around. Cousins of comparable intelligence and ability, which must have been incredibly scary, kind of like living with aliens. Some of them were very successful. Homo erectus, for example, survived for two million years, ten times longer than modern humans have existed. The last of the other humans disappeared around 10,000 years ago. We don't know what caused them to die out. Modern humans have at least a few percent of Neanderthal and other human DNA, so there was some mixing, but certainly not enough to be a merger between species. So we don't know if our cousins went away because they lost the battle over resources, or because of a series of minor genocides. Either way, only we remain. Back to the beginnings of humanity. 2.8 million years ago, early humans used tools, but did not make a lot of progress for nearly two million years, until they learned to control fire. Fire meant cooking, which made food more nutritious, which contributed to the development of our brain. It also produced light and warmth, which made days longer and winters less gruesome. On top of that, it not only scared predators away, it could also be used for hunting. A torched wood or grassland provided small animals, nuts and tubers, that were pre-roasted. From 300,000 years ago, most of the different human species lived in small hunter-gatherer societies. They had fire, wood and stone tools, planned for the future, buried their dead, and had cultures of their own. But most importantly, they spoke to each other. Probably in a kind of proto-language less complex than ours. If we had a time machine, how far would we be able to go back, steal a few babies, and raise them today without anyone noticing that they're a bit different? There is much debate. Anatomically modern humans emerged 200,000 years ago, but probably 70,000 years is as far as we could travel back and still snatch a behaviorally modern human. Before that, the babies would probably lack a few crucial gene mutations necessary to build a brain with modern language and abstract thinking abilities. At some point around 50,000 years ago, there was an explosion in innovation. Tools and weapons became more sophisticated, and culture became more complex. Because at this point, humans had a multi-purpose brain and a more advanced language to communicate information with each other effectively and down to the last detail. This allowed much closer cooperation and is what really makes us different from any other creature on earth. Not our comparatively weak bodies and inferior senses, but the ability to cooperate flexibly in large groups. Unlike, for example, rigid beehives or intimate but tiny wolf packs. As our brain evolved, we became able to do something life had been unable to do up to this point. One, expand knowledge quickly. Two, preserve the knowledge gained over generations. Three, build on past knowledge to gain even deeper insights. This seems daft, but until then, information had to be passed on from generation to generation, mostly through genetics, which is not efficient. Still, for the next 40,000 years, human life remained more or less the same. There was little to build upon. Our ancestors were only one animal among many. Building a skyscraper without knowing what a house is, is hard. But while it's easy to be arrogant in our attitude to our ancestors, this would be ignorant. Humans, 50,000 years ago, were survival specialists. They had a detailed mental map of their territory, their senses were fine-tuned to the environment, they knew and memorized a great amount of information about plants and animals. They could make complicated tools that required years of careful training and very fine motor skills. Their bodies compare to our athletes today, just because of their daily routines, and they lived a rich social life within their tribe. Survival required so many skills that the average brain volume of early modern humans might even have been bigger than it is today. As a group, we know more today, but as individuals, our ancestors were superior to us. But then, around 12,000 years ago, in multiple locations, humans developed agriculture. Everything changed very quickly. Before, survival as a hunter and forager required superb physical and mental abilities in all fields, from everybody. With the rise of the agricultural age, individuals could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival. This meant that some of them could specialize. Maybe they worked on better tools. Maybe they took time to breed more resistant crops or better livestock. Maybe they started inventing things. As farming got more and more efficient, what we call civilization began. Agriculture gave us a reliable and predictable food source, which allowed humans to hoard food on a large scale for the first time, which is much easier to do with grains than meat. A food stock required protection, which led to communities living together in tighter spaces. First, early defense structures were built. The need for organization grew. The more organized we got, the faster things became efficient. Villages became cities. Cities became kingdoms. Kingdoms became empires. Connections between humans exploded, which led to opportunities to exchange knowledge. Progress became exponential. About 500 years ago, the scientific revolution began. Mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology, and chemistry transformed everything we thought we knew. The industrial revolution followed soon after, laying the foundation for the modern world. As our overall efficiency grew exponentially, more people could spend their lifetime contributing to the progress of humanity. Revolutions kept happening. The invention of the computer, its evolution into a medium we all use on a daily basis, and the rise of the internet shaped our world. It's hard to grasp how fast all of that happened. It's been about 125,000 generations since the emergence of the first human species. About 7,500 generations since the physiologically modern human saw the light of day. 500 generations ago, what we call civilization began. 20 generations ago, we learned how to do science, and the internet became available to most people only one generation ago. Today, we live in the most prosperous age humanity has ever experienced. We have transformed this planet, from the composition of its atmosphere to large-scale changes in its landscape, and also in terms of the other animals in existence. We light up the night with artificial stars and put people in a metal box in the sky. Some have even walked on our moon. We put robots on other planets. We've looked deep into the past of the universe with mechanical eyes. Our knowledge and our way of acquiring and storing more of it has exploded. The average high school student today knows more about the universe than a scholar a few centuries ago. Humans dominate this planet, even if our rule is very fragile. We are still not that different from our ancestors 70,000 years ago, but your lifestyle has existed for less than 0.001% of human history. From here on, there's no saying what the future holds for us. We're building a skyscraper, but we're not sure if it's standing on a solid foundation or if we're building it on quicksand. Let's leave it with that for now. The next time you miss your train, your burger is not hot enough, or someone cuts in line, remember how special this made-up human world is. Maybe it's not worth being upset about all those little things. Okay, this was our first take on making a history-related video.

1e9c2dca-7c13-4469-bacb-d8c3b3ce6f56,"Hi, I'm Clint Smith, and this is Crash Course Black American History. Today, we'll be discussing the bloodiest war in American history, one that many historians now claim took the lives of over 750,000 people. More Americans died in this war than in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Spanish-American War, the Korean War, the Gulf War, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan all combined. It is a war that would change and define the trajectory of this country. We're talking about the Civil War. You've likely heard stories about the Civil War, about the so-called Great Generals, the gory battles, the decimated cities. It has been the subject of thousands of books, documentaries watched by millions around the world, and even the inspiration for a vast community of people who enjoy re-enacting great battles of the war. But something that doesn't get as much attention, at least not as much attention as it deserves, is the role that Black soldiers, and more generally, Black people, played in the war. But today, that is going to be the center of our attention. INTRO For such an important and consequential moment in American history, there sure are a lot of different interpretations about what the Civil War was fought over. So we should be clear, from the very beginning, about why the Southern states seceded and why the Civil War came to be fought. You ready? The Civil War was about slavery. Some people might say states' rights. Well, yeah, the Southern states' rights to keep their enslaved workers. Some people might say economics. Yes, the desire for Southern planters to maintain an economy that relied on the labor of millions of enslaved people. But don't take my word for it. All we have to do is look at the statements different governments and government representatives made as they were leaving the Union themselves. A state like Mississippi said, quote, Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery, the greatest material interest of the world. A state like Louisiana felt, quote, The people of the slave-holding states are bound together by the same necessity and determination to preserve African slavery. Or Texas, who said, quote, The African race had no agency in their establishment, that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race. Or we can take the words of the Vice President of the Confederacy, Alexander Stevens, who in his infamous cornerstone speech in 1861 stated that slavery was, quote, the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution, and that the Confederacy was founded on, quote, the great truth that the Negro is not equal to the white man. To understand what the Confederacy was fighting for, all we have to do is look at what they said for themselves. On the opposite side of the Confederacy was the federal army, who was fighting to preserve the Union after the southern states had begun seceding. And while the army was not stating outwardly at the beginning of the war that they were fighting to free the enslaved, the shadow of slavery hung over every battle and every decision. Over the course of the conflict, the tenor of the war, and the reason it continued, evolved and became clearer over time. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. When the war first broke out, at Fort Sumter in April of 1861, Black people didn't want to just sit by and watch, because they perhaps had the most to lose. Thousands volunteered to fight on the side of the Union when the war first erupted, but they were turned away. A federal law dating all the way back to 1792 barred Black people from bearing arms in the U.S. Army, even though they had served in the American Revolution and in the War of 1812. The Lincoln administration debated the idea of recruiting Black troops into the Union forces, but they were concerned that such a move would prompt the border states to secede. Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri were these kind of in-between players in the war because they stayed in the Union but also kept their enslaved workers. Additionally, beliefs of Black inferiority were widespread among white military officials, both on the Confederate and the Union side. They believed Black men to be too cowardly, too weak-minded, and too likely to give away sensitive military information under pressure. There was also a fear that if you gave Black men guns, they would desert and perhaps use those weapons to attack white people. Regardless of the military shutting Black Americans out, many who wanted to fight banded together on their own terms, forming groups in places like New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. A few brave Black men and women in the South also joined military units. In South Carolina, General David Hunter put an order in place that organized a group of runaways to become part of the 1st South Carolina Regiment. In Missouri, General John C. Fremont did something similar. Both units, however, were quickly disbanded by the government. But over the course of the war, Lincoln's position on the role of Black soldiers began to change. The Union was having a more difficult time recruiting white volunteers to serve in the Army for a war that many in the country initially thought would only last a few weeks. And Black abolitionists like Frederick Douglass had long been pushing Lincoln to make Black soldiers a part of the war effort. Additionally, there were shifting international dynamics shaping Lincoln's calculus. All of this led to the Emancipation Proclamation. A document that is widely misunderstood, Lincoln's proclamation was a military strategy with multiple aims. It prevented European countries from supporting the Confederacy by framing the war in moral terms and making it explicitly about slavery, something that Lincoln had previously backed away from. As a result, France and Britain, which had contemplated supporting the Confederacy, ultimately refused to do so because of each country's anti-slavery positions. The proclamation allowed the Union Army to recruit Black soldiers and it also threatened to disrupt the South's social order, which depended on the work and caste position of enslaved people. Lincoln had actually presented the proclamation to his cabinet in July of 1862, but William H. Seward, Lincoln's Secretary of State, told the President that if they announced it at that moment, it would look like a sign of weakness and desperation. Instead, he urged Lincoln to wait until the Union won a significant victory on the battlefield. This made sense to Lincoln, so he waited. The moment came on September 17, 1862, when Union troops halted the advance of Confederate forces in the Battle of Antietam. Just a few days afterwards, Lincoln publicly announced a preliminary version of the Emancipation Proclamation, which told the Confederate states that they had 100 days, by January 1, 1863, to rejoin the Union. And if they didn't, their slaves would be declared, thenceforward, and forever free. The Confederacy, obviously, didn't listen. And on January 1, Lincoln signed the proclamation. The document transformed the war effort, and people like Frederick Douglass went to work recruiting Black soldiers. A war undertaken and brazenly carried on for the perpetual enslavement of colored men, Douglass wrote in a broadside in 1863, calls logically and loudly for colored men to help suppress it. By the end of the war, the Union had more than 186,000 Black volunteers, 134,000 of them coming from slave state. What's more, over the course of the war, over 70% of Black men in the North who were of age would serve in the Union Army. The truth of the matter is that Black people had been fighting for freedom long before the war. Still, the Civil War did open up a whole slew of new opportunities for them to seize freedom. Untold numbers of runaways would find their way into the Union Army camps and seek refuge. Even before the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, the Confiscation Acts passed by Congress in 1861 and 1862 made it possible for Black people to obtain freedom if they joined these camps. Runaways helped the Union war effort by joining units in unofficial capacities, working as servants, and some were even able to work on land in Union strongholds for a wage. The Confiscation Acts got that name because acquiring runaways meant capturing enemy property. Accordingly, the camps became commonly known as contraband camps. Speaking of contraband camps, that brings us to Mrs. Susie Baker King-Taylor, the only Black woman to publish a book reflecting on her time spent in the contraband camps during the Civil War. The book was called Reminiscences of My Life in Camp with the 33rd United States Colored Troops, Late First South Carolina Volunteers. The book itself details her many adventures, facing death on several occasions, and the work she did as an educator. Taylor was the first Black American to teach formerly enslaved people publicly in a school in Georgia, a school that she helped to found. As Black men either fought or provided manual labor toward the war effort, Black women would often do medical work, cook for soldiers, or take care of the children. But the story of a woman named Harriet Tubman makes it evident that Black women's contributions were numerous, and that they were engaged in both combat and non-combat roles. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. Harriet Tubman is widely remembered for her work leading people to freedom via the Underground Railroad. Not only was she someone who helped enslaved people forge a path to freedom by going back and forth between the North and the South on multiple occasions, but she also served as a spy during the Civil War, like a legit spy. Tubman was paid by the Secret Service, and used those funds to recruit other Black folks to join and help gather information about the Confederates. Black people made great spies during the war, even if it was because of some not-so-great reasons. Like I said earlier, White people, especially, but not exclusively, Southerners, really underestimated Black people's intelligence. Not only did they think enslaved Black people weren't brave enough or clever enough to be spies, but often they simply treated Black people, especially Black women, like they were invisible. As a result, Black folks would sometimes be in the literal room where military officers were discussing war strategy, or while they were sharing new developments with their families over dinner. Through her intel, Tubman discovered and alerted the Union Army of where Confederate enemies were hiding along the shore and where they planted torpedoes in the water. And on top of being a spy, Tubman led a covert military operation, helping Colonel James Montgomery plan a raid to help free enslaved people along the Combahee River in South Carolina. On the morning of June 2, 1863, Tubman and three gunboats full of soldiers set fire to the buildings and bridges near the river so the Confederates couldn't use them. They ended up freeing 750 enslaved men, women, children, and babies. And they didn't lose a single soldier in the fight. Thanks, Thought Bubble. After being allowed to serve in the Union Army by the Emancipation Proclamation, Black soldiers would make up 10% of the Union forces and fought valiantly throughout the remainder of the Civil War. Seeing these Black soldiers fight and die for the Union changed the minds of many, including President Lincoln, about whether Black people deserve full citizenship in this country. Our go-to guy Frederick Douglass, who feels like he has a quote for everything, said, Once let the Black man get upon his person the brass letter U.S. Let him get an eagle on his button, and a musket on his shoulder, and bullets in his pocket. There is no power on earth that can deny that he has earned the right to citizenship. The war effectively ended in April 1865 when General Robert E. Lee of the Confederate Army surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia. Countless Black Americans remained in bondage even after Lee's surrender. And on June 19th of 1865, or what we now know as Juneteenth, General Gordon Granger let 250,000 enslaved people in Texas know, through General Order No. 3, that they were free. And some, in states like Kentucky and Delaware, were still waiting even after that. As historian W. Caleb McDaniel has said about the days, weeks, and years following Juneteenth, Slavery did not end cleanly or on a single day. It ended through a violent, uneven process. The war was done, but the struggle for Black freedom was in many ways just beginning. Thanks for watching, I'll see you next time."
2a981bad-e16e-455c-b1c6-e42ea2566b62,"Hi, I'm Clint Smith, and this is Crash Course Black American History. And today, we're learning about the transatlantic slave trade, which spanned nearly 400 years from the late 15th century to the late 19th century. The majority of enslaved Africans were taken from six primary regions, Senegambia, Sierra Leone and the Windward Coast, the Gold Coast, the Bata Benin, the Bata Biafra, and West Central Africa, also known as Congo and Angola. In his 1935 book, Black Reconstruction in America, scholar and civil rights leader W.E.B. Du Bois described the Atlantic slave trade as, quote, the most magnificent drama in the last thousand years of human history. And he didn't mean magnificent in a good way. INTRO I want to note up top that this episode will address some challenging topics, including sexual violence and images of extreme violence. We believe, however, it is important to discuss these ideas thoroughly so that we can fully grapple with the reality of U.S. history. An estimated 12.4 million people were loaded onto slave ships and carried through what became known as the Middle Passage, which moved across the Atlantic and included many different destinations. It was named the Middle Passage because it was the second of three parts of what became known as the Triangular Trade. The first leg of the journey carried cargo like textiles, iron, alcohol, firearms, and gunpowder from Europe to Africa's western coast. When the ships reached the coast of Western Africa, the cargo was exchanged for people. From there, ships loaded with human beings made their way to the Americas, where the enslaved Africans were sold in exchange for goods like sugar and tobacco before the ships made their way back to Europe. It's estimated that over the course of the Middle Passage, 2 million African captives died, their bodies often tossed overboard. What some people might not know about the slave trade is that the vast majority of people did not actually go to the United States, in fact, far from it. Only about 5% of captured Africans were brought directly to what would eventually become the U.S. The largest proportion, around 41%, went to Brazil, while millions of others were scattered across islands in the Caribbean and South America. As we examine slavery in the United States, from its earliest moments, when people were first taken from their homes, all the way through the end of the Civil War, it's important to lift up the narratives and accounts of enslaved people themselves as they can provide us with a perspective on this horrific institution in ways that few other documents can. For example, Olaudah Equiano, an African captured as a boy, wrote in his 1789 autobiography, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, about the experience of being captured and taken to the edge of the ocean and being boarded onto the ship. I was immediately handled and tossed up to see if I were sound by some of the crew, and I was now persuaded that I had gotten into a world of bad spirits and that they were going to kill me. Their complexions, too differing so much from ours, their long hair and the language they spoke, which was very different from any I had ever heard, united to confirm me in this belief. I looked round the ship, too, and saw a large furnace or copper boiling, and a multitude of black people of every description chained together, every one of their countenances expressing dejection and sorrow. I no longer doubted of my fate, and, quite overpowered with horror and anguish, I fell motionless on the deck and fainted. Captured Africans didn't really have an understanding of what lay ahead for them. Saved Africans weren't coming back to Africa from the Americas and warning people about what happened. All people knew was what they saw in front of them, a large ship, an endless ocean, and for many of these Africans, people speaking a language they had never heard, with a color skin some of them had never seen. It's also important to note that the story is not as simple as Africans being hunted and captured by Europeans and forced onto ships against their will. The Africans who were taken and placed on board these ships were typically prisoners of war from other African tribes, people deemed criminals, and poor members of society who were often traded to pay off their debt. Which is to say, many captured Africans were sold to Europeans by other Africans for a range of different goods. Now this fact can sometimes be used in bad faith to obfuscate the horrors of what the Europeans did. And while it's important not to ignore the fact that there were Africans trading other Africans into bondage, we should remember that being a prisoner of war or a poor member of society traded for goods is not the same thing as being held in intergenerational hereditary chattel slavery that meant your children, and their children, and their children would all be born into bondage. That is something unique to the experience of slavery in the Americas. As the scholar Orlando Patterson has written, Slavery is the permanent, violent, and personal domination of natally alienated and generally dishonored persons. You've likely heard about how horrible the conditions were on slave ships. But it's worth naming explicitly. The conditions on these ships were horrific. People were packed by the hundreds alongside one another, chained down, unable to move. The captured Africans were forced to relieve themselves in the same places where they slept, sat, and ate. As a result, the stench from the bottom of the ship, where there was little ventilation, was unbearable. Disease was rampant. From yellow fever to malaria, from smallpox to dysentery, it is difficult to capture how abhorrent the conditions were. To imagine this, it is helpful to hear from Equiano again. I was soon put down under the decks, and there I received such a salutation in my nostrils as I had never experienced in my life, so that, with the loathsomeness of the stench and crying together, I became so sick and low that I was not able to eat. The closeness of the place, and the heat of the climate, added to the number in the ship. Being so crowded that each had scarcely room to turn himself, almost suffocated us. This produced copious perspirations, so that the air soon became unfit for respiration from a variety of loathsome smells, and brought on a sickness among the slaves, of which many died. Violence against captured Africans was a devastating yet ubiquitous phenomenon as these ships crossed the Atlantic. In an effort to keep people submissive over the course of their several weeks long trip, enslaved Africans were tortured in a variety of cruel, unimaginable ways. Sexual violence was a common fixture as well. It was not uncommon for sailors to rape enslaved women while they were on board. But enslaved people didn't just passively accept the conditions that had been thrust onto them. They resisted in a myriad of ways. Some of these ways were individual, and some of them were collective. All of them were attempts to reclaim some sense of agency and control in just inconceivable circumstances. Sometimes, they were as explicit as staging revolts, meant to overthrow the crew. And sometimes, they included individual acts of resistance, like refusing to eat or jumping overboard. Now, the idea of trying to take one's own life might seem like a strange sort of resistance to some. But what you have to consider is that these captured Africans represented money, real money, to those who were holding them in chains on these ships. So someone attempting to take their own life represented the ability to determine the outcome of your life for yourself, rather than having it imposed on you by someone else. It also allowed them to undermine the economic incentives that undergirded the entire institution. Furthermore, in the case of jumping overboard, some of the captured Africans' spiritual beliefs gave them the sense that if they could just make it into the water, the ocean would carry their bodies home. Sometimes, as a result, the enslavers on the ship would put nets on the side of the boat to prevent people from jumping into the sea. One of the most heinous responses to slave resistance during the Middle Passage came in the form of something called speculum aurum, which was a screw-like device that forced someone's mouth open and allowed the resistant African to be force-fed against their will. It was not uncommon for this device to break someone's teeth, displace their jaw, or rip their mouth apart. If that didn't work, other interventions included placing hot coals on a person's lips until they opened their mouths, or thumbscrews, a device in which a victim's fingers or toes were placed in a vice and slowly crushed until they complied. Given all this, we should be clear that the decision millions made to stay alive in the face of unimaginable violence and uncertainty, that too was an act of resistance. Historian Marcus Rediker identifies the period from 1700 to 1808 as the most destructive time of the transatlantic slave trade. Roughly two-thirds of the total of enslaved Africans were trafficked out of Africa and to the Americas during this period. What's more, the death toll of the transatlantic slave trade was just staggering. According to historian Jill Lepore, for every 100 people taken from Africa's interior, only 64 of them would survive the trip to the coast itself. Of those 64, only around 48 would survive the weeks-long journey across the Atlantic. Of those 48 who stepped off the ship, only 28-30 would survive the first 3-4 years in the colony. Before we go on, a quick note here about language. Throughout this series, we will try to be consistent in using the term enslaved rather than slave to refer to African and African-descended people who were held here in bondage. This distinction is important because saying enslaved person or enslaved worker or enslaved human being centers the personhood of that individual and emphasizes that slavery is a condition that was involuntarily imposed on someone, rather than being an inherent condition to someone's existence. One of the central players in the slave trade was England's Royal African Company, a chartered firm that maintained a monopoly on all English trade to Africa following its inception in 1672. The period of 1675-1725 represented the most active years of the Royal African Company, but it continued to play an active role in the first several decades of the 18th century, an era known as free trade. The irony of that term is not lost on me. I think it's worth honing in on one state and its particular relationship to the slave trade in order to better understand how this thing played out. According to the work of historian Ira Berlin, the state of South Carolina prohibited the African slave trade beginning in 1787. In 1803, however, the state reopened the transatlantic slave trade, and it remained open until 1808 when the federal prohibition of the Atlantic slave trade went into effect. Between 1803 and 1808, over 35,000 enslaved people were brought to South Carolina, more than twice as many as in any similar period in its history as a colony or state. The coast of Charleston was the point of entry for approximately 40% of the enslaved Africans who were brought to North America through the Middle Passage. This has led some to refer to it as African Americans' Ellis Island, though an obvious difference is that one group came here via their own free will, and one group did not. The federal government ended the international slave trade in 1808. The British had done so in 1807. However, traders from both nations continued illegally trafficking captive Africans for many years later. And while the international slave trade was abolished in the United States, the domestic slave trade would continue. In Britain, it took another quarter century before slavery was officially abolished in 1833. And in the United States, it took almost another 60 years and our nation's deadliest war to end it. Spanish and Brazilian traders continued trafficking Africans for another half century. Brazil, which remember, had the largest proportion of enslaved people trafficked across the ocean, was the final country in the Western world to abolish slavery, doing so in 1888. The bottom line is that the transatlantic slave trade was a cruel, violent, abhorrent, centuries-long project that would shape the trajectory of the world and of both black and white life in ways that we'll come to more fully understand. We'll continue to talk about some of these in our next few episodes. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.

8fb2d5e1-0722-4cd0-9b09-bab135997572,"Hi, I'm Clint Smith, and this is Crash Course Black American History. Today, we'll be discussing a hero of mine, somebody who used her writing, research, and unrelenting commitment to become one of the most important anti-lynching advocates in American history. We are talking about the one, and the only, Mrs. Ida B. Wells Barnett. Her anti-lynching campaign brought international attention to the omnipresent threat of violence plaguing Black Americans in the South and in other parts of the United States. Her career would also lead her to becoming one of the founding members of the National Association of Colored Women and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Her work was invaluable in the early struggle for Black American civil rights, and she helped lay the groundwork for generations of Black activists and journalists who would come after her. Let's start the show. I want to note up top that there will be mentions of physical and sexual violence in this episode. Wells was born enslaved in 1862 in Holly Springs, Mississippi. Wells' father, James, was involved with the Freedmen's Aid Society and helped to establish a college for newly freed Black Americans in Holly Springs called Shaw University. Renamed West College in 1892, the school would join the ranks of a growing number of HBCUs, or Historically Black Colleges and Universities, formed during this period. On a personal note, as the child, and the grandchild, and the nephew, and the cousin, and the husband of people who all went to HBCUs, I can't begin to express how important these schools have been to the Black community, places that, for years, were the only institutions that Black people could count on for higher education. Given her father's work, Wells grew up around Black folks who were trying to build a better, more just society for her people. But after losing both of her parents and one of her siblings to yellow fever, she became the primary caregiver to her five brothers and sisters. Wells found herself taking care of her siblings while also working as a teacher and attending school at Rust College. During this time, she discovered her passion for writing. In 1882, Wells moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where her career as a journalist would begin. She became co-owner of a local newspaper, where she wrote passionate editorials and conducted in-depth investigative work to shine a light on the widespread acts of lynchings in the South. Lynching, or killing by way of mob without a trial, became a common form of retribution in the South as a means of administering vigilante justice absent of due process. These acts of violence took many forms, perhaps most infamously, hanging a person from a tree. These acts were designed to inspire fear and were used as an intimidation tactic against African Americans to assert social, political, and economic control. And unfortunately, Black Americans in the South had to live with the looming threat that such violence could happen to them or their family at any moment. It's important to remember also that this history wasn't that long ago. In my own book, How the Word is Passed, I describe how my own grandfather, born in 1930 Mississippi, told me a story of how, when he was a boy, a Black man in a small town of just 1,000 people was kidnapped by night riders, hung from a tree, and castrated. And this sort of thing was happening all across the South. Lynchings could and often did take place without the victim having been charged with any sort of crime. And even if someone had been charged with a crime, a vigilante mob kidnapping someone in the middle of the night and killing them is not justice, no matter what the accusation is. As you can imagine, people were scared. To speak out against lynching would put a target on your back. And what's remarkable about Ida B. Wells is that she knew this and did it anyway. And while Wells was brave, she was also strategic. Wells' editorials and investigative reporting angered many local whites. And while she wanted to make waves, she understood that to be effective, she needed to stay alive. So she published many articles in Black newspapers and periodicals under the moniker IOLA. Lynching was not the only cause Ida B. Wells took a stand against. She also sued the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Company for discrimination. As the story goes, she purchased a first-class train ticket for a ride from Memphis to Woodstock, Tennessee. But the train crew ordered her to move to the car reserved for African Americans. But Wells did not leave the first-class car voluntarily. The conductor and some passengers forcibly removed her and kicked her off the train. She won a $500 settlement in a circuit court case. But that decision was later overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1887. Following this train situation, Wells became even more impassioned to combat discrimination against Black Americans in all areas. For example, while working as a journalist, Wells became a teacher at a segregated public school in Memphis, Tennessee. That first-hand experience led her to begin writing about educational inequality, and this time under her own name. As a result, in 1891, after publicly criticizing the lack of resources for Black-only schools in the area, she was fired. The following year, her efforts as a journalist refocused on the lynching problem in the South after she lost three of her friends. Calvin McDowell, Thomas Moss, and Will Stewart owned a store called The People's Grocery in Memphis. The presence of this moderately successful Black-owned business sparked anger and unrest among the local white community. On March 3, 1892, a group of white men, including a sheriff's deputy, went to The People's Grocery to confront McDowell, Moss, and Stewart. This led to an altercation, and by the time it was over, some of the white men had been injured. As a result, McDowell, Moss, and Stewart were arrested, and some Memphis newspapers referred to the men's efforts to defend themselves and their store as an armed rebellion by the Black men in Memphis. Just a few days later, at 2.30 in the morning, a mob of 75 masked men broke into the jail and kidnapped McDowell, Moss, and Stewart. They were brought to the edge of the town, and they were lynched. In the aftermath of the tragedy, Wells launched an extensive investigation on lynching and used her publications to openly denounce the practice. She traversed the southern states for two months to gather information on other acts of lynching, and in October of 1892, she published a pamphlet entitled Southern Horrors, which detailed all of her findings. Wells stayed in the North and never returned to Memphis, but that did not keep her from writing about the horrors of lynching in the South. Wells also took her research and anti-lynching campaign across the Atlantic, specifically to Great Britain in the 1890s. She helped establish the British Anti-Lynching Society in 1894, and her work on the transatlantic anti-lynching circuit demonstrates the ways African American women activists internationalize social justice work. This built on the work of earlier abolitionists, like Frederick Douglass and William Wells Brown, who also traveled to England to promote the abolitionist cause. In 1895, Wells published The Red Record, which outlined the horrors of lynching to a northern audience whom Wells did not think was fully aware of everything that was going on in the South, writing that thousands of black people had been killed in cold blood without the formality of judicial trial and legal execution. She also used the pamphlet to challenge the rape myth that whites used to justify the lynching of African American men. See, a significant component of the culture of lynching was the idea of protecting white womanhood from black men who were stereotyped as being over-sexualized and always waiting for their chance to sexually attack a white woman. Countless black men were lynched after being wrongfully accused of raping, assaulting, eyeing, or even speaking to a white woman. Wells' research, however, revealed that many victims of lynchings had not committed any crimes at all, but had rather challenged white supremacy. Challenging white supremacy could include anything from being a black person simply leading a successful life as a business owner to refusing to cross the street when passing a white person. According to the Equal Justice Initiative, more than 4,000 black Americans were lynched in the South alone, between 1877 and 1950. And this is only the numbers that we know. There's every reason to believe that the numbers could be even higher than that. Wells had completed much of her life's work before marrying in 1895 to an attorney and newspaper editor, Ferdinand L. Barnett. The couple would have four children. Still, even after starting a family, Wells believed that her work was not done. In 1896, Wells was among the founding members of the National Association of Colored Women. The founding convention was held in Washington, D.C., and other founding members included Harriet Tubman, Frances E.W. Harper, and Mary Church Terrell. And I don't know about y'all, but that's basically like the Avengers. And she kept going. In 1898, Wells took her anti-lynching campaign to the White House. She led a protest in Washington, D.C., calling for President William McKinley to make reforms, and she called for President Woodrow Wilson to end discriminatory hiring practices in government jobs. And throughout the remainder of her life, she was incredibly active in the fight for women's suffrage. A determined woman in every respect, Ida B. Wells is one of America's greatest heroes. She had the determination and the bravery required to stand up against one of the darkest elements of America's past, and in many ways helped lay the groundwork for both the Civil Rights Movement of the mid-20th century and the Black Lives Matter movement of today. Her life's work was dedicated to stopping the unjust murderings of Black Americans in the South, a practice that, due to the widespread, profoundly entrenched influence of the Klan, was often protected by law enforcement and legal policies. Wells died of kidney disease on March 25, 1931, at the age of 68, in Chicago, Illinois. Her legacy is a remarkable one. She did so much for so many, and used her gifts and determination to help build a better world."
b07c143b-8d28-48b4-a0b9-1e3e660da3aa,"The title of Thomas Piketty's book is Capital in the 21st Century, so it's probably worth having a conversation about what capital is. So if you're going to produce anything, so you wanna produce anything, you need some input, you need some factors for that production. So you would put them together. So let's say that you are a farm. You are a farm, your output is food. Well, what are your inputs going to be? So this is a farm right over here. Let me draw a little circle here. Farm, and your output is food. What are your inputs going to be? Well, you're going to need some land. You're going to need some water. You're going to need some equipment. Equipment, equipment, and then you're going to need some, maybe you might need some seeds and animals, and so I'll just put generally here supplies. Supplies, and of course, you're going to need people to put all these things together and essentially work the land to plow the soil and plant the seeds and harvest the crops and manage the whole operations. So you're going to need labor. You're going to need labor as well. So you take all of these factors of production together. They essentially represent a farm that is going to output food. So when people talk about capital as a factor of production, sometimes they talk about it in a fairly narrow way. They'll separate things like land and resources as something separate, and they'll say capital is, hey, that's your equipment and your supplies, but when people talk in more general terms, especially in the focus of this book, when we're talking about labor versus capital, capital, when we just group things in only those two categories, in that context, capital would essentially represent pretty much everything else. So this right over here would be capital, and one way to think about capital is the things that you could maybe you, they are assets that you have that can be valued that will give you future benefit. You can buy and sell those assets, and we can think about other businesses here, or other things that are trying to produce something. So let's say you have a, let's say that you have a mine. A mine. So a mine, so this is the operation, and it's going to produce, let's just say it's a gold mine. So it's going to produce gold. So what are the inputs that you would need there? Well, you're clearly going to need some labor. You're going to need the miners and the people who would manage the operation of the gold mine, but that's not all you need. You also need energy, maybe to operate your equipment, and actually I would put energy in here too, some of which comes from the sun, but some of which you might have to purchase or have somehow, and then you would also need equipment, equipment, and you would need supplies. I mean, we could consider energy a supply if you like, or you need a supply of energy, but you also might need, I don't know, tires or something like that. You might need food in order to provide for the labor. Who knows what else you might need in your mine? And you also would need, of course, land. You need access to land to actually mine. So here, if we think in very broad terms, you could view all of this as the capital, all of this as the capital, and of course you have your labor and you put your labor and your capital together and you produce the gold. Now, another idea that you will hear in, well, you'll hear in life a lot, but obviously in a book about capital this will come up a lot, is the idea of return on capital. Return, return on capital. And this is just a measure of, given a value of capital that you have employed, how much income are you getting for that capital? So, for example, let's say that, let's say that, let's say this farm. The total value of this capital, let's just say it is, I don't know, I'll make up a number here. Let's just say it is $1 million. $1 million is the total value of the land and maybe you have access to your own lake and the equipment and the supplies here. It's $1 million of capital. The value of that capital is $1 million. And let's say that the income of the farm after you pay the labor, so actually let's just do this in a little broader terms. Let's say the food's value, the food that's produced has a value of $100,000 in the market. Now, out of that $100,000, you obviously had to pay your labor. So let's say that $50,000 of it goes to the labor. $50,000 goes to the labor. And we're saying this is in a given year. So you use the capital of the labor, you produce $100,000 worth of food. $50,000 goes to the labor. What's going to be your return on capital? Well, you have another $50,000 left over for the capital, for the owners of the capital, whoever owned the farm. So the owners of the capital would get the other $50,000. So your return on capital is going to be $50,000. That's what the owner of the capital gets and it's the return on their investment of $1 million. $1 million. And this is going to be, this is going to be the same thing as five divided by 100, or it would be 5%. You have a 5% return on capital. You invest $1 million, you're going to get $50,000. If it was a 6% return on capital, you invest $1 million, you get $60,000. Now that we've kind of thought about that a little bit, let's actually look at a pretty neat chart from the book. And once again, it's pretty neat. If you look right over here at Piketty.psc.ens.fr, capital 21C, he has all the charts from his book, which make for interesting analysis at minimum. And he's gathered all of this information. This is pretty interesting. This is capital and slavery in the United States. And what's interesting about that is when you study American history, you talk a lot about slavery, but you need to realize that in the time of slavery, as abhorrent as it is and was, people viewed slaves as capital, not as labor, as they viewed them as something that they could buy or sell, that they own and that would create future income for them. And this just gives us a sense of kind of the breakdown of capital over history. You see down, at least in the United States, you see agricultural land. In 1770, it was a reasonable percentage. This is the value of capital as a percentage of national income. So the value of the land as a percentage of national income was much higher than it is today. And we see the other trend, that the other domestic capital has become much more, much more valuable. You say, well, what is this other domestic capital? Well, this could be things like infrastructure, it could be technology, it could be mechanical technology, things like trains and cars and trucks and buses, or, and factories, or it could be software, it could be computers, whatever else. And as we see as we went through the Industrial Revolution, the value of other forms of technology became, or other forms of capital other than land became more and more important for our economy. And obviously slavery ended, slavery ended in the late 1860s, mid-late 1860s, and obviously that went away. But it's just an interesting way to think about macroeconomic trends in the United States. Land in 1770 was a major factor of production, and still is, obviously, we still need land in order to produce things, especially agriculture, well, this is agricultural land, you still, it's still a major part, it's not like the land has disappeared, it's just that the economy has grown to be much more than just agriculture. So in 1770, agriculture was a big part of our economy, now agriculture is a much, much smaller part of our economy. So this is just an interesting way to think about, well, okay, this is all of the capital, and this is both public and private capital included here. So public capital would be something that is owned by the public, by the government, while private capital would be something that is owned by private individuals or corporations or whatever else. But you see, on average, you have had kind of a fairly constant, you know, give or take a little bit, that the total value of the capital has been around four to five times the value of the total productive output. Four to five times the value of the total productive output of the country."
cd8308a6-03d7-4581-aef6-b2f5e7d8eada,"Hi, I'm Clint Smith, and this is Crash Course Black American History. Today, we'll be discussing a hero of mine, somebody who used her writing, research, and unrelenting commitment to become one of the most important anti-lynching advocates in American history. We are talking about the one, and the only, Mrs. Ida B. Wells Barnett. Her anti-lynching campaign brought international attention to the omnipresent threat of violence plaguing Black Americans in the South and in other parts of the United States. Her career would also lead her to becoming one of the founding members of the National Association of Colored Women and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Her work was invaluable in the early struggle for Black American civil rights, and she helped lay the groundwork for generations of Black activists and journalists who would come after her. Let's start the show. I want to note up top that there will be mentions of physical and sexual violence in this episode. Wells was born enslaved in 1862 in Holly Springs, Mississippi. Wells' father, James, was involved with the Freedmen's Aid Society and helped to establish a college for newly freed Black Americans in Holly Springs called Shaw University. Renamed West College in 1892, the school would join the ranks of a growing number of HBCUs, or Historically Black Colleges and Universities, formed during this period. On a personal note, as the child, and the grandchild, and the nephew, and the cousin, and the husband of people who all went to HBCUs, I can't begin to express how important these schools have been to the Black community, places that, for years, were the only institutions that Black people could count on for higher education. Given her father's work, Wells grew up around Black folks who were trying to build a better, more just society for her people. But after losing both of her parents and one of her siblings to yellow fever, she became the primary caregiver to her five brothers and sisters. Wells found herself taking care of her siblings while also working as a teacher and attending school at Rust College. During this time, she discovered her passion for writing. In 1882, Wells moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where her career as a journalist would begin. She became co-owner of a local newspaper, where she wrote passionate editorials and conducted in-depth investigative work to shine a light on the widespread acts of lynchings in the South. Lynching, or killing by way of mob without a trial, became a common form of retribution in the South as a means of administering vigilante justice absent of due process. These acts of violence took many forms, perhaps most infamously, hanging a person from a tree. These acts were designed to inspire fear and were used as an intimidation tactic against African Americans to assert social, political, and economic control. And unfortunately, Black Americans in the South had to live with the looming threat that such violence could happen to them or their family at any moment. It's important to remember also that this history wasn't that long ago. In my own book, How the Word is Passed, I describe how my own grandfather, born in 1930 Mississippi, told me a story of how, when he was a boy, a Black man in a small town of just 1,000 people was kidnapped by night riders, hung from a tree, and castrated. And this sort of thing was happening all across the South. Lynchings could and often did take place without the victim having been charged with any sort of crime. And even if someone had been charged with a crime, a vigilante mob kidnapping someone in the middle of the night and killing them is not justice, no matter what the accusation is. As you can imagine, people were scared. To speak out against lynching would put a target on your back. And what's remarkable about Ida B. Wells is that she knew this and did it anyway. And while Wells was brave, she was also strategic. Wells' editorials and investigative reporting angered many local whites. And while she wanted to make waves, she understood that to be effective, she needed to stay alive. So she published many articles in Black newspapers and periodicals under the moniker IOLA. Lynching was not the only cause Ida B. Wells took a stand against. She also sued the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Company for discrimination. As the story goes, she purchased a first-class train ticket for a ride from Memphis to Woodstock, Tennessee. But the train crew ordered her to move to the car reserved for African Americans. But Wells did not leave the first-class car voluntarily. The conductor and some passengers forcibly removed her and kicked her off the train. She won a $500 settlement in a circuit court case. But that decision was later overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1887. Following this train situation, Wells became even more impassioned to combat discrimination against Black Americans in all areas. For example, while working as a journalist, Wells became a teacher at a segregated public school in Memphis, Tennessee. That first-hand experience led her to begin writing about educational inequality, and this time under her own name. As a result, in 1891, after publicly criticizing the lack of resources for Black-only schools in the area, she was fired. The following year, her efforts as a journalist refocused on the lynching problem in the South after she lost three of her friends. Calvin McDowell, Thomas Moss, and Will Stewart owned a store called The People's Grocery in Memphis. The presence of this moderately successful Black-owned business sparked anger and unrest among the local white community. On March 3, 1892, a group of white men, including a sheriff's deputy, went to The People's Grocery to confront McDowell, Moss, and Stewart. This led to an altercation, and by the time it was over, some of the white men had been injured. As a result, McDowell, Moss, and Stewart were arrested, and some Memphis newspapers referred to the men's efforts to defend themselves and their store as an armed rebellion by the Black men in Memphis. Just a few days later, at 2.30 in the morning, a mob of 75 masked men broke into the jail and kidnapped McDowell, Moss, and Stewart. They were brought to the edge of the town, and they were lynched. In the aftermath of the tragedy, Wells launched an extensive investigation on lynching and used her publications to openly denounce the practice. She traversed the southern states for two months to gather information on other acts of lynching, and in October of 1892, she published a pamphlet entitled Southern Horrors, which detailed all of her findings. Wells stayed in the North and never returned to Memphis, but that did not keep her from writing about the horrors of lynching in the South. Wells also took her research and anti-lynching campaign across the Atlantic, specifically to Great Britain in the 1890s. She helped establish the British Anti-Lynching Society in 1894, and her work on the transatlantic anti-lynching circuit demonstrates the ways African American women activists internationalize social justice work. This built on the work of earlier abolitionists, like Frederick Douglass and William Wells Brown, who also traveled to England to promote the abolitionist cause. In 1895, Wells published The Red Record, which outlined the horrors of lynching to a northern audience whom Wells did not think was fully aware of everything that was going on in the South, writing that thousands of black people had been killed in cold blood without the formality of judicial trial and legal execution. She also used the pamphlet to challenge the rape myth that whites used to justify the lynching of African American men. See, a significant component of the culture of lynching was the idea of protecting white womanhood from black men who were stereotyped as being over-sexualized and always waiting for their chance to sexually attack a white woman. Countless black men were lynched after being wrongfully accused of raping, assaulting, eyeing, or even speaking to a white woman. Wells' research, however, revealed that many victims of lynchings had not committed any crimes at all, but had rather challenged white supremacy. Challenging white supremacy could include anything from being a black person simply leading a successful life as a business owner to refusing to cross the street when passing a white person. According to the Equal Justice Initiative, more than 4,000 black Americans were lynched in the South alone, between 1877 and 1950. And this is only the numbers that we know. There's every reason to believe that the numbers could be even higher than that. Wells had completed much of her life's work before marrying in 1895 to an attorney and newspaper editor, Ferdinand L. Barnett. The couple would have four children. Still, even after starting a family, Wells believed that her work was not done. In 1896, Wells was among the founding members of the National Association of Colored Women. The founding convention was held in Washington, D.C., and other founding members included Harriet Tubman, Frances E.W. Harper, and Mary Church Terrell. And I don't know about y'all, but that's basically like the Avengers. And she kept going. In 1898, Wells took her anti-lynching campaign to the White House. She led a protest in Washington, D.C., calling for President William McKinley to make reforms, and she called for President Woodrow Wilson to end discriminatory hiring practices in government jobs. And throughout the remainder of her life, she was incredibly active in the fight for women's suffrage. A determined woman in every respect, Ida B. Wells is one of America's greatest heroes.

78b5cb30-c278-4d0b-9d25-c2c868d3b252,"Hi, I'm Clint Smith, and this is Crash Course Black American History. And today, we're learning about the transatlantic slave trade, which spanned nearly 400 years from the late 15th century to the late 19th century. The majority of enslaved Africans were taken from six primary regions, Senegambia, Sierra Leone and the Windward Coast, the Gold Coast, the Bata Benin, the Bata Biafra, and West Central Africa, also known as Congo and Angola. In his 1935 book, Black Reconstruction in America, scholar and civil rights leader W.E.B. Du Bois described the Atlantic slave trade as, quote, the most magnificent drama in the last thousand years of human history. And he didn't mean magnificent in a good way. INTRO I want to note up top that this episode will address some challenging topics, including sexual violence and images of extreme violence. We believe, however, it is important to discuss these ideas thoroughly so that we can fully grapple with the reality of U.S. history. An estimated 12.4 million people were loaded onto slave ships and carried through what became known as the Middle Passage, which moved across the Atlantic and included many different destinations. It was named the Middle Passage because it was the second of three parts of what became known as the Triangular Trade. The first leg of the journey carried cargo like textiles, iron, alcohol, firearms, and gunpowder from Europe to Africa's western coast. When the ships reached the coast of Western Africa, the cargo was exchanged for people. From there, ships loaded with human beings made their way to the Americas, where the enslaved Africans were sold in exchange for goods like sugar and tobacco before the ships made their way back to Europe. It's estimated that over the course of the Middle Passage, 2 million African captives died, their bodies often tossed overboard. What some people might not know about the slave trade is that the vast majority of people did not actually go to the United States, in fact, far from it. Only about 5% of captured Africans were brought directly to what would eventually become the U.S. The largest proportion, around 41%, went to Brazil, while millions of others were scattered across islands in the Caribbean and South America. As we examine slavery in the United States, from its earliest moments, when people were first taken from their homes, all the way through the end of the Civil War, it's important to lift up the narratives and accounts of enslaved people themselves as they can provide us with a perspective on this horrific institution in ways that few other documents can. For example, Olaudah Equiano, an African captured as a boy, wrote in his 1789 autobiography, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, about the experience of being captured and taken to the edge of the ocean and being boarded onto the ship. I was immediately handled and tossed up to see if I were sound by some of the crew, and I was now persuaded that I had gotten into a world of bad spirits and that they were going to kill me. Their complexions, too differing so much from ours, their long hair and the language they spoke, which was very different from any I had ever heard, united to confirm me in this belief. I looked round the ship, too, and saw a large furnace or copper boiling, and a multitude of black people of every description chained together, every one of their countenances expressing dejection and sorrow. I no longer doubted of my fate, and, quite overpowered with horror and anguish, I fell motionless on the deck and fainted. Captured Africans didn't really have an understanding of what lay ahead for them. Saved Africans weren't coming back to Africa from the Americas and warning people about what happened. All people knew was what they saw in front of them, a large ship, an endless ocean, and for many of these Africans, people speaking a language they had never heard, with a color skin some of them had never seen. It's also important to note that the story is not as simple as Africans being hunted and captured by Europeans and forced onto ships against their will. The Africans who were taken and placed on board these ships were typically prisoners of war from other African tribes, people deemed criminals, and poor members of society who were often traded to pay off their debt. Which is to say, many captured Africans were sold to Europeans by other Africans for a range of different goods. Now this fact can sometimes be used in bad faith to obfuscate the horrors of what the Europeans did. And while it's important not to ignore the fact that there were Africans trading other Africans into bondage, we should remember that being a prisoner of war or a poor member of society traded for goods is not the same thing as being held in intergenerational hereditary chattel slavery that meant your children, and their children, and their children would all be born into bondage. That is something unique to the experience of slavery in the Americas. As the scholar Orlando Patterson has written, Slavery is the permanent, violent, and personal domination of natally alienated and generally dishonored persons. You've likely heard about how horrible the conditions were on slave ships. But it's worth naming explicitly. The conditions on these ships were horrific. People were packed by the hundreds alongside one another, chained down, unable to move. The captured Africans were forced to relieve themselves in the same places where they slept, sat, and ate. As a result, the stench from the bottom of the ship, where there was little ventilation, was unbearable. Disease was rampant. From yellow fever to malaria, from smallpox to dysentery, it is difficult to capture how abhorrent the conditions were. To imagine this, it is helpful to hear from Equiano again. I was soon put down under the decks, and there I received such a salutation in my nostrils as I had never experienced in my life, so that, with the loathsomeness of the stench and crying together, I became so sick and low that I was not able to eat. The closeness of the place, and the heat of the climate, added to the number in the ship. Being so crowded that each had scarcely room to turn himself, almost suffocated us. This produced copious perspirations, so that the air soon became unfit for respiration from a variety of loathsome smells, and brought on a sickness among the slaves, of which many died. Violence against captured Africans was a devastating yet ubiquitous phenomenon as these ships crossed the Atlantic. In an effort to keep people submissive over the course of their several weeks long trip, enslaved Africans were tortured in a variety of cruel, unimaginable ways. Sexual violence was a common fixture as well. It was not uncommon for sailors to rape enslaved women while they were on board. But enslaved people didn't just passively accept the conditions that had been thrust onto them. They resisted in a myriad of ways. Some of these ways were individual, and some of them were collective. All of them were attempts to reclaim some sense of agency and control in just inconceivable circumstances. Sometimes, they were as explicit as staging revolts, meant to overthrow the crew. And sometimes, they included individual acts of resistance, like refusing to eat or jumping overboard. Now, the idea of trying to take one's own life might seem like a strange sort of resistance to some. But what you have to consider is that these captured Africans represented money, real money, to those who were holding them in chains on these ships. So someone attempting to take their own life represented the ability to determine the outcome of your life for yourself, rather than having it imposed on you by someone else. It also allowed them to undermine the economic incentives that undergirded the entire institution. Furthermore, in the case of jumping overboard, some of the captured Africans' spiritual beliefs gave them the sense that if they could just make it into the water, the ocean would carry their bodies home. Sometimes, as a result, the enslavers on the ship would put nets on the side of the boat to prevent people from jumping into the sea. One of the most heinous responses to slave resistance during the Middle Passage came in the form of something called speculum aurum, which was a screw-like device that forced someone's mouth open and allowed the resistant African to be force-fed against their will. It was not uncommon for this device to break someone's teeth, displace their jaw, or rip their mouth apart. If that didn't work, other interventions included placing hot coals on a person's lips until they opened their mouths, or thumbscrews, a device in which a victim's fingers or toes were placed in a vice and slowly crushed until they complied. Given all this, we should be clear that the decision millions made to stay alive in the face of unimaginable violence and uncertainty, that too was an act of resistance. Historian Marcus Rediker identifies the period from 1700 to 1808 as the most destructive time of the transatlantic slave trade. Roughly two-thirds of the total of enslaved Africans were trafficked out of Africa and to the Americas during this period. What's more, the death toll of the transatlantic slave trade was just staggering. According to historian Jill Lepore, for every 100 people taken from Africa's interior, only 64 of them would survive the trip to the coast itself. Of those 64, only around 48 would survive the weeks-long journey across the Atlantic. Of those 48 who stepped off the ship, only 28-30 would survive the first 3-4 years in the colony. Before we go on, a quick note here about language. Throughout this series, we will try to be consistent in using the term enslaved rather than slave to refer to African and African-descended people who were held here in bondage. This distinction is important because saying enslaved person or enslaved worker or enslaved human being centers the personhood of that individual and emphasizes that slavery is a condition that was involuntarily imposed on someone, rather than being an inherent condition to someone's existence. One of the central players in the slave trade was England's Royal African Company, a chartered firm that maintained a monopoly on all English trade to Africa following its inception in 1672. The period of 1675-1725 represented the most active years of the Royal African Company, but it continued to play an active role in the first several decades of the 18th century, an era known as free trade. The irony of that term is not lost on me. I think it's worth honing in on one state and its particular relationship to the slave trade in order to better understand how this thing played out. According to the work of historian Ira Berlin, the state of South Carolina prohibited the African slave trade beginning in 1787. In 1803, however, the state reopened the transatlantic slave trade, and it remained open until 1808 when the federal prohibition of the Atlantic slave trade went into effect. Between 1803 and 1808, over 35,000 enslaved people were brought to South Carolina, more than twice as many as in any similar period in its history as a colony or state. The coast of Charleston was the point of entry for approximately 40% of the enslaved Africans who were brought to North America through the Middle Passage. This has led some to refer to it as African Americans' Ellis Island, though an obvious difference is that one group came here via their own free will, and one group did not. The federal government ended the international slave trade in 1808. The British had done so in 1807. However, traders from both nations continued illegally trafficking captive Africans for many years later. And while the international slave trade was abolished in the United States, the domestic slave trade would continue. In Britain, it took another quarter century before slavery was officially abolished in 1833. And in the United States, it took almost another 60 years and our nation's deadliest war to end it. Spanish and Brazilian traders continued trafficking Africans for another half century. Brazil, which remember, had the largest proportion of enslaved people trafficked across the ocean, was the final country in the Western world to abolish slavery, doing so in 1888. The bottom line is that the transatlantic slave trade was a cruel, violent, abhorrent, centuries-long project that would shape the trajectory of the world and of both black and white life in ways that we'll come to more fully understand. We'll continue to talk about some of these in our next few episodes. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.

c47dcaaf-a635-4174-b347-e759086244f8,"Hey there, I'm Mike Rugnetta. This is Crash Course Theater. And as much as we may all adore the violence and raunch of Roman performance, it's time to move on. Ugh. Yorick. Are you disappointed? I know it well. You're a fan of the rope-dancing maidens, aren't you? So bawdy, this one. The theater of Greece and Rome is only one tradition. And today, we're going to survey another, Sanskrit theater. We could devote several episodes to classical Indian theater, but because we have two and a half millennia of opening nights from around the world to cover in this series, today is more of a highlights reel. And those highlights include happy endings, rectangular theaters, and fish bellies. We don't really know when Sanskrit theater started or how it evolved, but likely it followed a process similar to Greek drama. And spoiler alert, the future re-emergence of theater in the medieval period. Basically, people create religious rituals to honor their gods. Someone gets the bright idea that instead of just singing praises, it might be cool to act out some devotion. And before you know it, you have characters and plots, and sometimes a chorus of frogs. Theater. Sanskrit literature starts at around 1500 BCE. And like Greek literature, it was originally an oral tradition. Its great works, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, weren't written down until much, much later. The Mahabharata is an epic tale of a battle between two groups of cousins. The Ramayana is a more intimate family narrative that also involves a monkey king. Yeah, it's as dope as it sounds. Most Sanskrit dramas are based on excerpts from these epics. There's no solid date for the first Sanskrit dramas either, though we do have a bunch of surviving plays from the first century CE, suggesting this tradition had already been around for a while. The Golden Age for Sanskrit drama comes a little bit later, around the 4th and 5th centuries during the Gupta dynasty, which was a good time if you were into science, math, or theater. That's us. All told, about two dozen dramas survive. We're going to look at one later in this episode. The plays were typically written in a mix of Sanskrit, the fancy literary dialect, and Prakrit, the more common dialect. If the Greeks have taught us anything, it's that if you want to have a great age of drama, you need someone to come along and lecture you on how to do it right. In Sanskrit theater, instead of Plato and Aristotle, we have Bharata Muni. Speaking historically, he may not actually have been a real person, but more of a literary construct like Homer. Except he was also semi-divine. Sorry, Homer. We still think you're fabulous. Sometime early in the Common Era, Bharata Muni wrote the Nati Shastra, which is basically an all-purpose guide to theater. How to write it, how to stage it, how to watch it, all the different ways an actor can move her nose, and much more. So, so much more. It's like Aristotle's Poetics, if after writing about tragedy, Aristotle decided to write about everything else. Oh, and the Nati Shastra is also structured as a 6,000-verse poem. Obviously, we're not going to have time to summarize all of the Nati Shastra. Turns out there are lots of nose movements. I'm partial to this one. But we will look at the philosophies that underlie the composition of plays. We'll also look at how plays should be performed, at least according to Bharata Muni. But first, let's check out the Nati Shastra's theory of the origins of drama. Theater, it says, was created by Brahma, because Brahma's job is creating stuff. See CC World Mythology with this handsome half-bird, sir. Don't worry, Tote and I still hang out on the weekends. Brahma and some other gods are worried that the scriptures are just too literary, so he comes up with drama as a religious teaching tool. Brahma teaches it to the god Bharata, who teaches it to his 100 sons. They prepare a play about that awesome time that the god Indra defeated some demons. The gods in the audience love the play. The demons, not so much. They start wilding out, and Indra has to defeat them again. The demons are still pretty upset, but they are reassured that some plays will make fun of the gods, so they agree to stop their attack. Man, and you thought your preview audiences were tough. Yeesh. In the exciting origin story, the Natyashastra introduces the idea of rāsas. Greek and Roman plays were divided by genre—comedy, tragedy, sadder plays. Sanskrit theater is different. Instead of genre, plays are defined by the kinds of moods they evoke. These moods are called rāsas. There are initially eight of them—erotic, comic, pathetic, furious, heroic, terrible, odious, and marvelous. Eventually, a ninth rāsa is added—peace. A very nice mood to evoke, not terrible or odious in the least. How do you evoke these rāsas, you might ask? A playwright does it by drawing on eight major human emotions, which are called bhavas. There are eight of those—pleasure, mirth, sorrow, wrath, vigor, fear, disgust, and wonder. You put the bhavas together in the right combination, and you evoke the appropriate rāsa. Hold the odious phone, though. Not only are there nine rāsa moods and eight bhava emotions, there are also ten categories of play, somewhat based on length, because a Sanskrit drama can have between one and ten acts. These categories don't have precise English translations, but most surviving plays belong to two main categories—nādaka plays and prukhanana plays. Nādaka plays are five to ten acts long. They usually borrow stories from the classic Sanskrit epics and deal with gods and heroes and demons. These plays are a little like tragedies, except, like most Sanskrit plays, they end happily. This helps the audience live in harmony with the universe—which, I mean, hey, not a terrible aim for the arts, right? Prukhanana plays are also five to ten acts long. These are closer in spirit to Roman comedies in that they often have urban settings and deal with everyday human characters. Other kinds include dīma plays, which have sixteen heroes, and anka, one-act plays in which women lament. Very exciting things happen in these plays, like kidnappings and battles and berserk elephants, but those things mostly happen offstage. On stage, we get messengers, reports, and dialogue about how people are dealing with invading monkey forces, but not usually the monkey forces themselves. Which, I mean, makes sense. What director wants to manage the blocking for an army of monkeys? Besides what types of plays there are, the Nāti Shastra also has a lot of ideas about how plays should be staged. Like Greek and Roman theater, Sanskrit theater was often staged in conjunction with religious festivals and preceded by elaborate religious rituals. But unlike Greek and Roman theater, players weren't exclusively men. Troops were male, female, and mixed gender. Plays were also sometimes commissioned as court performances. Bharata Muni says although the best spectators are noble, theater is for all classes. Members of the four castes—priests, warriors, merchants, and peasants—all seem to have gone to the theater, though they didn't get to sit together. No classical Sanskrit theaters survive, and sadly we know nothing about their concession snacks. But Bharata Muni does have some pointers on architecture. Theaters could be rectangular, square, or triangular, and small, medium, or large. The medium-sized rectangle was the most popular design. And in case you're thinking, hey, isn't bigger better? It turns out you are more right than you think because large rectangles are reserved for the gods. Half of the theater was for the audience and the other for the stage and the backstage. There were also four color-coded pillars. And the whole thing was meant to symbolize the entire universe. No pressure. And if you think that seems precise, wait until you hear about acting. Acting in the classical Indian theater is incredibly specific and highly stylized. The way a performer stands, and blinks, and crooks a finger, and flares her nostrils—all of that is conveying vital information about her character and the circumstances of the play. The Nati Shastra lists six ways you can move your nose, nine ways you can move your neck. There are seven ways you can move your eyebrows, each with its own distinct meaning. From lowering in envy, disgust, and smelling to contracted in manifestation of affection. And don't even get Bharata Muni started on the eyes, or the fingers, or the feet. That said, it's communicating through emotion that matters most. Rhythm and music, costume and makeup are also crucially important props, too. But not scenery. Sanskrit drama doesn't do scenery. To get a feel for how these plays, uh, played out, let's take a look at one of the most beloved Sanskrit dramas, Kalidasa's The Recognition of Shakuntala. No solid date for this one, but best guess early in the Common Era. Thought bubble? You better recognize. In the first act, King Dushyanta is out hunting deer near a bunch of hermitages when he decides to hide behind a tree, perving on some beautiful hermit maidens. Especially Shakuntala. The king falls in love, but oh dip, she's in the wrong cast. The king mopes because he's so in love with the hermit girl and is trying to find an excuse to see her. But then, two youths come and ask him to protect the hermitage. Score. Before long, the king and Shakuntala confess their love. By the next act, their wedding has taken place, and also, presumably, sex. Then the king has to leave to do king stuff. Daydreaming, Shakuntala accidentally offends the touchy poet Durvasa, so he curses her, telling her that King Dushyanta will forget all about her until she presents him with a token, like the ring he conveniently left. Shakuntala, who is pregnant, brings the king his kingly ring to bring to mind their forbidden fling. But alas, the king fails to recognize her, and she's like, but wait, I have this ring, which fell into the Ganges. Whoops. Shakuntala leaves the palace dejected, and after a long while, a fisherman finds what is clearly a kingly ring in the belly of a fish. When the king sees it, he remembers Shakuntala, but is busy fighting demons. After the king defeats them, Indra rewards him with a ride through the heavens. In the final act of the play, Act 7, the chariot lets the king off at a hermitage. And even after all the years, he recognizes Shakuntala and his son. Thank you Thought Bubble, reunited! And it feels so good, yay. A happy ending, harmony with the universe achieved. As you can see, Anattaka is very different from its Greco-Roman counterparts. Seven acts, a lot of events, a multi-year span, a ton of locations, and a distinct mix of tragedy and comedy and prayer and sex and hermits. Sorta has it all. And then some. Maybe even a rampaging elephant. Somehow it all comes together to help the audience achieve that harmony with the universe. Nice work, Kalidas. Sanskrit drama thrived for hundreds of years. But in the next episode, we're going to go back to Rome to talk about the decline of drama. There's going to be a whole mess of trouble from the Goths and the Visigoths, and then for a bunch of centuries, no Western theater at all. Unless you count mimes. Turns out the Dark Ages means Dark Nights for theater, too. Get it, York? Because a Dark Night is a night where there isn't a performance in a theater, and it's closed? Tough customer, this guy.

8ee39628-0ce7-454a-93bb-b6e6506a6f21,"Hello readers, I'm going to draw you a map right now and it's gonna look like I've drawn a mountain. But it's not a map of a mountain, it's a map of a story. What? You're saying, how do you map a story? What makes a story pointy? These are great questions and to answer them I'll say this, today we're going to talk about the elements of a story or the parts that make it up like ingredients in a recipe. Many stories follow a similar pattern. Good readers know what these patterns are and can talk about them using the right terms. And this helps everyone be on the same page, so to speak, when you discuss or write about the stories you read. I'm about to drop a lot of vocabulary on you so brace yourselves. The story begins with exposition where we learn about the characters and the setting. Then we introduce a conflict or a big problem. As the characters begin to interact with the conflict or try to solve the problem, we enter rising action, this upward slope of the story mountain. When the conflict comes to a head, we hit the most exciting part of the story, the climax. Here, the conflict can't go any further. We're at the top of the mountain. There's nowhere else to go except down. After the climax, after this most exciting part of the story, we enter falling action. The climax will happen much closer to the end of the story than to the middle. It's not a symmetrical mountain. The action slows down, the problem has been solved or maybe the problem has changed and the characters prepare for the last phase of story, the resolution. This is where we tie up loose ends, characters reflect on what they learned, maybe you set up a sequel. Now, look, that was a lot of information all at once. In order to make sense of it, let's apply all of those terms to a story. Now, our go-to has been The Three Little Pigs and while that's a story everyone knows, I'm starting to think it needs to be freshened up a little bit, really work on its franchise potential, you know? So let's go through the elements of story by looking at my new project, a reboot of Three Little Pigs that I'm calling TLP Starbound. See, it's Three Little Pigs, but it's in space. That's a space helmet. So I'm gonna put a little story map here in the corner. Okay, so the exposition, it's the future. Pigs have expanded to every corner of the galaxy. Three brave little pigs decide to strike out on their own, exploring a new, exciting region of space. One builds a spaceship out of straw, go with me here. One builds a spaceship out of twigs. And one builds a spaceship out of a flexible hyper alloy they developed in a laboratory, she's the brainy pig. So we've got the setting, it's the future, they're in space. We've got our characters, the pigs. Now, the conflict. Along comes the notorious space pirate, Captain Wolf. He's big, he's bad. He wants to blow up the spaceships and eat the pigs. He begins hunting down the pig ships one at a time. See, Captain Wolf has an eye patch. No, he has a cyber eye. He's part robot. And now we enter our rising action phase. Captain Wolf engages the straw ship. They have an exciting space battle. Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew. And straw pig escapes in a little escape pod to the twig ship. But Captain Wolf follows, he is undaunted. The tension continues to rise. He destroys the twig ship. Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew. The two pigs escape again, this time to the brick house. I mean, the flexible hyper alloy spaceship piloted by the science pig. And now we come to the climax. Captain Wolf comes to the advanced ship. He tries to blow it up, but he can't, it's too powerful. He decides to board the ship because that's the only way he'll get to eat the pigs. But the pigs trap him in a space barrel while he's still in the airlock. They did it. They solved the problem. Captain Wolf is trapped in a space barrel and he can't eat them now. The climax is past. And now we enter the falling action phase of the story. In the version of the story that I know, the three little pigs roll the barrel into the river. So I think maybe in this version, they punt the space barrel out the airlock into the cold void of space. Or maybe they strand him on a deserted planet. But in any case, they never have to deal with the wolf again. The threat is now gone. And that means that the conflict has been resolved. We're in the resolution part of the story now. The first two little pigs, the straw ship pig and the twig ship pig, learn that they need to put more work into their spaceships if they wanna survive in space. And they build fancy spaceships just like the science pig. And that's an introduction to story elements. Now that you're familiar with the ideas, start applying them to your favorite stories. You can do this with any form of media, books, comics, TV shows, movies, games. What's the conflict? How is it resolved? Once you start looking for story structure in entertainment, you will find it everywhere. Let us know what you see. You can learn anything. David out."
82e2a037-c278-455b-9699-820c58cfe23c,"Hey, this is Kim from Khan Academy, and today I'm learning about Article Four of the U.S. Constitution. Article Four lays out the nuts and bolts of how federalism, the system of shared governance between states and the federal government, works in practice. Article Four has four sections. The first two, the Full Faith and Credit Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause, talk about how states will treat each other's citizens as well as they treat the citizens of their own states. Then the third section is an Admissions Clause, discussing how new states will be added to the union. And the fourth section is the Guarantee Clause, which guarantees every state in the union a Republican form of government. To learn more about Article Four, I sought out the help of two experts. Erin Hawley is an Associate Professor of Law at the University of Missouri. Her scholarship focuses on the federal courts, and she teaches constitutional litigation, tax policy, and agricultural law. Professor Gabriel Chin is the Director of Clinical Legal Education at the UC Davis School of Law. He's a teacher and scholar of immigration law, criminal procedure, and race and law. So Professor Hawley, can you take us a little bit through why the Framers included Article Four? What was its purpose? The founders of the Constitution were very concerned that the federal government be one of limited powers. And because of that, they saw the states as having an active and critical role in placing a check on the federal government. So we've got the three branches and their own checks and balances, and then we've got the federal government and the state government also playing a role in checking and balancing each other. They wanted to establish a strong central government, but also to ensure that it didn't have too much power, and the states were critical to this effort. Also, they very much wanted the states to act collectively, not individually. As you'll recall, the states had not been doing so well under the loose Articles of Confederation. They'd sort of been going it alone on critical issues like trade and defense as to the detriment of the union. So Article Four is also sort of key to making sure that the states act sort of as a unified whole rather than going it alone. It's one country made up of diverse states. And if you prefer the way things are done in Nevada, you can move there. And if you think that some other state has a better set of answers to the problems of modern life, you can move. What the Full Faith and Credit Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause are designed to do is to facilitate transactions, to facilitate moving, to facilitate communications and commerce and trade and travel among the states. But that doesn't mean that what's going on in each of the states can't be very, very different. We often think of checks and balances as being something that was designed to be kind of horizontal, that the legislature and the executive branch and the judicial branch kind of all at the same level checking each other. But there's also kind of this vertical checks and balances happening too, between the power of the federal government, power of the states and the power of the local governments. Absolutely. So we've got the three branches and their checks and balances, but we also have a strong central government that's checked in large part by strong independent sovereign governments in each of the 50 states. And these states traditionally have what are known as police powers. So they have a lot of inherent authority to govern the people in those states, subject to federal law. But it really does sort of place a check on federal authority. And I think this is precisely what the framers wanted because they did want a strong government, but they also were very much of the view that states were important, that their own states were important and they didn't want to lose that in the new constitution and new federal government. There are four sections in article four. And the first section deals with full faith and credit. It says full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of every other state. So what does full faith and credit actually mean? It's designed to make in a certain sense, all of the states of the United States part of a single system. And so full faith and credit means that a court judgment, for example, in one state will be recognized in every state. So if you have a valid judgment in New York, for example, and you move to California, the California courts are required to give effect to that judgment, to that state court judgment, so long as it was validly issued. There was a federal statute known as the Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA that was passed under President Clinton. And recently the Supreme Court struck that down as unconstitutional. So now under full faith and credit, if you're married in one state, you're married in another state as well. You can see the kinds of problems that would exist if states didn't honor the legal decisions that were made by other states, such as who's married or who's divorced, or who owns a particular piece of property, or whether a particular child is going to be in the custody of one parent rather than another. And the full faith and credit clause is designed to say, in order for our system to work as a unified whole, while it's true that the courts of Georgia are distinct from the courts of New York, et cetera, they're separate systems, but they have to treat the work that each other does with respect. If we move on to section two, this says that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states. So what are these privileges and immunities? So the privileges and immunities clause has been one that's subject to a number of sort of debate in the courts, in the academic literature, but basically privileges and immunities have been construed to be those sorts of things that would go with citizenship. So the right to travel, for example, is a privilege and immunity, those sorts of things. Occasionally in American history, there have been moments where states didn't wanna let citizens of other states come through. So during the depression, there was an effort by some states to limit the migration of people from out-of-state to in-state. And the Supreme Court said, that's not permissible. It also protects the right to travel. In 1999, the Supreme Court dealt with a case called Sines versus Roe. And what that case was about is that California had relatively generous welfare benefits, and California wanted to set up its law in such a way that it wouldn't encourage people from other states to move to California just to get the welfare benefits. And so what they did is they said that if you don't live in California, if you're moving from out-of-state and you apply for welfare benefits, then we're gonna give you the welfare benefits that you would have gotten in your state for the first year. We're not gonna give you the higher California benefits. We're gonna give you whatever you would have gotten where you came from. That's unconstitutional. And the Supreme Court said that violates the privileges and immunities clause where one country, one nation, people are allowed to cross the borders whenever they want. Interesting, but there's this second part of it that says no person held to service or labor in one state under the laws thereof, escaping into another shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from service or labor. So what is that all about? So that is one of the most unfortunate, probably the most unfortunate clauses in our Constitution. It's known as the Fugitive Slave Clause. And that title is pretty descriptive. So if you have a slave who is validly owned, as it were in those days, under one state's law, and that person escaped to a free state, this clause gave the owner the right to reclaim that slave and put them back into sort of ownership in their own state. It is a sneaky way of talking about slavery. And this compromise with slavery was necessary to create the United States. Slavery, the word, isn't used in the Constitution. They only use these euphemisms, these sort of complicated circumlocutions. And there's an argument that there's a reason for that. And the reason for that is that a lot of the framers of the Constitution didn't support slavery, opposed slavery. They did think that it was important to have a United States and to have a Constitution. So they wanted to do what was necessary to achieve that, but they did the absolute minimum. And they did it in such a way that consciously doesn't recognize and legitimize the institution of slavery. All right, so then we get into new states and territories. So I think it was very forward-looking of the framers to recognize that new states might wanna join the Union and then to provide a process for that. So can you tell us a little bit about what that process was like? So Article 4, Section 3, Clause 1 provides the process for admitting new states. Again, it recognizes that new states might want to join the Union. And it gives a wide latitude to Congress for admitting new states. So basically the process was that a territory would indicate to the Congress that it wished to become a state. Then they would submit a Constitution and Congress would approve the new state. But the Constitution itself in Article 4 places some limitations on that. Some of the Eastern states were concerned that the large Western territories might become too influential. So they had a couple of provisions that no new state could be created out of an old state, nor could parts of states be combined to form a new state unless there was consent from all of the involved states. And it's not so clear that purchase of territory from foreign governments was a power that was granted in the Constitution to anyone. Thomas Jefferson, who was the president at the time of the Louisiana Purchase, had doubts that the Louisiana Purchase was constitutional. He thought that it was a great idea to purchase all that land from France, but he thought that it would require a constitutional amendment for the United States to have that power. This is different from Texas joining the Union. But the House and the Senate didn't have the same qualms that President Jefferson did. And so they agreed to approve the Louisiana Purchase and to fund it. When the bill got to Thomas Jefferson's desk, he signed it. Moving on to Section 4, there's this promise here that the federal government will guarantee every state a Republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion or domestic violence. What does this mean? So we see here in Article 4, the end of Article 4, a really sort of famous and important promise to each of the individual states. The federal government is promising to basically aid them in keeping a Republican form of government. As we'll remember, Benjamin Franklin famously said, we've given you a republic if you can keep it. So when we talk about invasion, when Section 4 talks about invasion, it's pretty clear that what they're talking about is invasion by some hostile state. And of course, during this period, there was continuing conflict with England. And the idea is that if New York or South Carolina gets invaded by England, that's not just that particular state's problem, it's the nation's problem. And the national government has an obligation to protect against invasion. And I imagine it also prevents someone from, for example, declaring themselves the King of Maryland. The Republican form of government clause does that. It leaves the details to the states. But the basic idea is that the concept of Republican government that's embodied in Article 4 is majority rule. That even if there were free and fair elections, the state could not choose to have military or hereditary government. So even if everybody in California got together and said, you know, what we really need is a good family that generation after generation will lead us, and they will be the kings and queens of California. And this is what we want. And so we're going to amend our constitution to provide for hereditary leadership in our state. And we're gonna find somebody great, and this is what we wanna do. Article 4 would say we can't choose to do that even through democratic means. So as we've learned, Article 4 requires states to give full faith and credit to the legal proceedings of other states and to treat the citizens of other states as well as they treat their own citizens. It provides a process for adding new states into the mix and guarantees a Republican form of government to the citizens of all the states. Article 4 binds the United States together. So it's not just a collection of independent states, but rather a unified nation.

2a1533cc-71d6-4efe-9d85-f4ebf01757d5,"We know that an element is defined by the number of protons it has. For example, potassium, we look at the periodic table of elements, and I have a snapshot of not the entire table, but part of it here. Potassium has 19 protons, and we could write it like this. And this is a little bit redundant. We know that if it's potassium, that atom has 19 protons, and we know if an atom has 19 protons, it is going to be potassium. Now, we also know that not all members of, or not all of the atoms of a given element have the same number of neutrons. And when we talk about a given element, but we have different numbers of neutrons, we call them isotopes of that element. So, for example, potassium can come in a form that has exactly 20 neutrons, and we call that potassium 39. And the 39, this mass number, it's a count of the 19 protons plus 20 neutrons. And this is actually the most common isotope of potassium. It accounts for 93.3. I'm just rounding off. This is 93.3% of the potassium that you would find on Earth. Now, some of the other isotopes of potassium, you also have potassium, and once again, writing the K and the 19 are a little bit redundant. You also have potassium 41, so this would have 22 neutrons. 22 plus 19 is 41. This accounts for about 6.7% of the potassium on the planet. And then you have a very scarce isotope of potassium called potassium 40. Potassium 40 currently has 21 neutrons, and it's very, very, very, very scarce. It accounts for only 0.0117% of all the potassium. But this is also the isotope of potassium that's interesting to us from the point of view of dating old, old rock, and especially old volcanic rock. And as we'll see, when you can date old volcanic rock, it allows you to date other types of rock or other types of fossils that might be sandwiched in between old volcanic rock. And so what's really interesting about potassium 40 here is that it has a half-life of 1.25 billion years. So the good thing about that, as opposed to something like carbon-14, it can be used to date really, really, really old things. And every 1.25 billion years, that's its half-life, so 50% of any given sample will have decayed, and 11% will have decayed into argon-40. So argon is right over here. It has 18 protons. So when you think about it decaying into argon-40, what you see is that it lost a proton, but it has the same mass number. So one of the protons must have somehow turned into a neutron. It actually captures one of the inner electrons, and then emits other things, and I won't go into all the quantum physics of it, but it turns into argon-40, and 89% turn into calcium-40. And you see calcium on the periodic table right over here is 20 protons. So this is a situation where one of the neutrons turns into a proton. This is a situation where one of the protons turns into a neutron. And what's really interesting to us is this part right over here. Because what's cool about argon, and we studied this a little bit in the chemistry playlist, it is a noble gas. It is unreactive. And so when it is embedded in something that's in a liquid state, it'll kind of just bubble out. It's not bonded to anything, and so it'll just bubble out and just go out into the atmosphere. So what's interesting about this whole situation is you can imagine what happens during a volcanic eruption. Let me draw a volcano here. So let's say that this is our volcano, and it erupts at some time in the past. So it erupts, and you have all of this lava flowing. All of this lava. And while the lava, that lava will contain some amount of potassium-40, and actually it'll already contain some amount of argon-40. It'll already contain some amount of argon-40. But what's neat about argon-40 is that while it's lava, while it's in this liquid state, so let's imagine this lava right over here. It's a bunch of stuff. It's a bunch of stuff right over here. But in that stuff, it is going to have, I'll do the potassium-40 in, let me do it in a color that I haven't used yet. I'll do the potassium-40 in magenta. It'll have some potassium-40 in it. I'm maybe overdoing it. It's a very scarce isotope. But it'll have some potassium-40 in it, and it might already have some argon-40 in it. So it might already have some argon-40 in it. Just like that. But argon-40 is a noble gas. It's not going to bond to anything. And while this lava is in a liquid state, it's going to be able to bubble out. It's going to be able to bubble out. It'll just float to the top. It has no bonds. And it'll just evaporate. I should say evaporate. It'll just bubble out, essentially, because it's not bonded to anything. And so it'll just seep out while we are in a liquid state. And what's really interesting about that is that when you have these volcanic eruptions, and because this argon-40 is seeping out, by the time this lava has hardened into volcanic rock, all of the argon-40 will be gone. It won't be there anymore. And so what's neat is this volcanic event, the fact that this rock has become liquid, it kind of resets the amount of argon-40 there. So then you're only going to be left with potassium-40 here. You're going to be left with potassium-40. And that's why the argon-40 is more interesting, because the calcium-40 won't necessarily have seeped out. And there might have already been calcium-40 here, so it won't necessarily seep out. But the argon-40 will seep out, so it kind of resets it. The volcanic event resets the amount of argon-40. So right when the event happened, you shouldn't have any argon-40 right when that lava actually becomes solid. And so if you fast-forward to some future date, and if you look at the sample, let me copy and paste it. So if you fast-forward to some future date, and you see that there is some argon-40 there, you see that there is some argon-40 in that sample, you know this is volcanic rock. You know that it was due to some previous volcanic event. You know that this argon-40 is from decayed potassium-40. And you know that it has decayed since that volcanic event, because if it was there before, it would have seeped out. So the only way that this would have been able to get trapped is if, while it was liquid, it would seep out, but once it's solid, it can get trapped inside the rock. And so you know that the only way this argon-40 can exist there is by decay from that potassium-40. So you can look at the ratio. So you know for every one of these argon-40s, because it's only 11% of the decay products are argon-40, for every one of those, you must have on the order of about 9 calcium-40s that also decayed. And so for every one of these argon-40s, you know that there must have been 10 original potassium-40s. And so what you can do is you can look at the ratio of the number of potassium-40s there are today to the number that there must have been, based on this evidence right over here, to actually date it. And in the next video, I'll actually go through the mathematical calculation to show you that you can actually date it. And the reason this is really useful is you can look at those ratios, and volcanic eruptions aren't happening every day, but if you start looking over millions and millions of years, on that timescale, they're actually happening reasonably frequent. And so if you dig in the ground, and so let's dig in the ground. So let's say this is the ground right over here, and you dig enough, and you see a volcanic eruption. You see some volcanic rock right over there, and then you dig even more. There's another layer of volcanic rock right over there. So this is another layer of volcanic rock. And let's say that this one over here, so they're all going to have a certain amount of potassium-40 in it. This is going to have some amount of potassium-40 in it. And then let's say this one over here has more argon-40. This one has a little bit less. And using the math that we're going to do in the next video, let's say you're able to say that this is, using the half-life, and using the ratio of argon-40 that's left, or using the ratio of the potassium-40 left to what you know was there before, you say that this must have solidified 100 million years ago, 100 million years before the present. And you know that this layer right over here solidified, let's say you know it solidified 150 million years before the present. And let's say you feel pretty good that this soil hasn't been dug up and mixed or anything like that. It looks like it's been pretty untouched when you look at these soil samples right over here. And let's say you see some fossils in here. Then, even though carbon-14 dating is kind of useless, really when you get beyond 50,000 years, you see these fossils in between these two periods. It's a pretty good indicator, if you can assume that this soil hasn't been dug around and mixed, that this fossil is between 100 million and 150 million years old. This event happened, then you have these fossils got deposited, these animals died, or they lived and they died, and then you had this other volcanic event. So it allows you, even though you're only directly dating the volcanic rock, it allows you when you look at the layers, it allows you to relatively date things in between those layers. So it isn't just about dating volcanic rock. It allows us to date things that are very, very, very old and go way further back in time than just carbon-14 dating."
23343beb-986c-4b31-a1be-d6fae48deb36,"For us modern humans with our easy access to the local supermarket, it's easy to forget that throughout human history, and even today, the amount of humans or the human population has been limited by our ability to get calories or get human consumable food from the land. So what I want to do in this video is give us a little bit of a framework for thinking about how humans have been gathering calories from the land and how that's placed an upper limit on the number of humans that can live in any given area or the population density of humans. So right over here, you have some gentlemen looking for food. They are hunter-gatherers. I'll say HG for short. And the H part, the hunter part, they might actually find some animals. I think these guys right over here are trying to trap some rabbits. And the gathering part, they're just literally looking for food. Maybe they find fruit of some sort or some nuts or maybe some roots that are edible by humans. So literally, they just walk around, either try to kill things or find things that they can consume. So I'll call this right over here stage one. Actually, let me write it over here. So this is hunter-gatherers. And this is what most humans have done through most of human history. And just to give us a little bit of a framework for maybe how much they could get from the land, and I looked at some of our best sense of studying hunter-gatherer populations. In land like this, maybe they can get about 200 calories. And I'll make this whole column right over here. This whole column right over here is the amount that they could get in terms of calories per square kilometer per day. Now, it's obviously going to be hugely dependent on the number of animals that are there, the type of land that's there. If they're next to a stream where maybe fish are just jumping out of the stream, this number would be much higher. If they were in some type of a desert, this number would be much lower. But this is actually fairly in line with some of the studies of hunter-gatherer cultures. Now, if this is the number of calories that they can get from each square kilometer per day, how many humans can live in a square kilometer per day? Or what is the density of humans? Well, to figure that out, we have to know on average how many calories does a human need to survive. And for the sake of this video, I'm going to make the assumption that a human being needs 2,000 calories per day to survive in a non-malnourished state. And obviously, it's hugely dependent on how active this person is or how large they are. And one other note, in this whole video, I'm going to be using calories with a capital C. And the calories with a capital C are the calories that people are used to referring to when you go to the gym and you run on the treadmill and it says how many calories you've burned or you look at the back of your candy bar and it says 200 calories. These are the calories I'm talking about. They are a slightly different notion than the calories that you encounter in chemistry class. Those calories are calorie with a lowercase c. And just so that you can be optimally confused, it turns out that one calorie with an uppercase C is equal to 1,000, 1,000 calories with a lowercase c. 1,000 calories. And the lowercase c calories is the amount of energy needed to heat one gram of water one degrees Celsius. And so this is what you see in your chemistry class, but this is not what we're going to be talking about in this video. We're talking about the capital C, the calories that dietitians are always talking about. So with this assumption that the average human needs 2,000 calories a day to not get malnourished, and obviously men would need more, women would need less, children would need even less, but with this assumption, what is the density of humans that could be supported by this culture right over here? Well, 200 calories is 1 10th of the average daily human requirement if you believe this assumption. So the population density, so the density in, let me write it, humans per square kilometer, you can only support 1 10th of a human with this calorie output. So you can only support 1 10th of a human per square kilometer. So one human would actually need 10 square kilometers of hunter-gatherer, to hunt from and gather from in order to support just themselves. They would need maybe 30 or 40 square kilometers to support an entire family so that they could wander around and kill the animals and find whatever they need to find on that land. Now let's go to kind of, you can view it as maybe the next stage, although it's not always the case that herding is going to be more productive than hunter-gatherers, especially in the case where the fish are jumping out of the water. But let's go to this scenario right over here. So this is, we can call this a pastoral lifestyle. So this is two, I'll call it pastoral. And over here is the realization that, look, you have all of this vegetation that maybe humans can't consume, but there are other animals that can consume this vegetation, and they can turn those calories into calories that can be consumed by a human, and namely, the calories are themselves. So this gentleman right over here, after he gets these sheep to be nice and fat, he can either eat the sheep or he can drink their milk. So one way to think about it is these cattle or these sheep right over here, by herding them and letting them eat the grass, he's turning non-human consumable calories into human consumable calories. And so for the sake of our thought experiment, let's say we get a 10 times increase in the human consumable calories per square kilometer. So now instead of 200, we're up to 2,000. And so instead of one human per square kilometer, we have enough calories per square kilometer per day to support one human. So instead of 0.1, we can now support one human. So in that 10 square kilometers, we can now support 10 people. In 100 square kilometers, we could now support 100 people. Now, the next stage, and I'm skipping a bunch of stages because you have things like subsistence agriculture and various forms, and they're not going to be equally productive, and it depends what the land is like, and it depends what the tools are at your disposal. But the next stage that I'll just kind of jump to, we can call traditional agriculture. So this right over here, let's call that traditional agriculture. And that's this one over here as well. So both of these, I'm gonna call traditional agriculture. And for the purposes of this video, the difference between traditional agriculture and modern agriculture, in traditional agriculture, you didn't have mechanization, so you didn't, or very primitive mechanization. You definitely did not have fossil fuel-based engines. You didn't have modern pesticides. You did not have modern genetically engineered crops. But you did have some of the basic science of breeding crops and irrigating and using animals as tools. So in this stage right over here, and once again, it completely depends on where you are on the planet, how fertile the land is, how good your tools are, what crops you're actually producing. Let's assume that we got a hundredfold increase in productivity. And looking at some of the historical records, it looks like, depending on, once again, where you are, that's not out of the realm of possibility. So you have a hundredfold increase. So instead of 2,000 calories per square kilometer per day, you can get 200,000. 200,000 calories per square kilometer per day. And now you could support 100 humans per square kilometer, if you wanted to. So you might not have a hundred humans. One, not all the land you might be able to farm from. Or there are other limits on the population for whatever they might be. But the important thing to think about this upper bound, in this traditional, if you are able to get this type of productivity from your land, and you're able to, in theory, support a hundred people per square kilometer, that means if all of a sudden you have 200 people living there, maybe everyone's migrated to this land because it seems especially fertile, or all the really smart farmers live there, then all of a sudden, not everyone's going to be able to get 2,000 calories a day. Some people might get malnourished. Other people might actually starve. There's this upper bound on the actual number of people that can be there, based on how productive the land actually is. And now let's move over to modern agriculture. And we've already talked a little bit about what exactly is modern agriculture. You have machines like this combine over here that does a lot of the human labor. One human can, and I'll talk about the different dimensions because there's actually two dimensions here. How much calories can you get from the land? And how much energy can one human, how much labor can one human input into the land using tools at their disposal? So in this case, cattle, these ox pulling this plow, or in this case, this combine that's fueled by fossil fuels. But in modern agriculture, because of all of the things, you have these amazing tools, you have genetically engineered crops, you have modern pesticides, and not everyone is a fan of all of these things, but they have hugely increased our productivity. So you have modern agriculture. And let's say that you get another factor of 10 from traditional agriculture. So now you can get 2 million calories per square kilometer per day, or you can support 1,000, you can support 1,000 humans, 1,000 humans per square kilometers. And once again, this right over here, this right over here is an upper bound. And just to give a sense, and I picked these numbers just so that the numbers would be clean. I looked at some historical records. These aren't completely out of line with what it looks like humans have been able to do in the past. But to give you a sense of what human population densities look like right now, and why this upper bound seems to be right about correct, in a place like the United States, so in the United States, the population density is 30 people per square kilometer. So this is 30 humans per square kilometer. In a more dense country, or significantly more dense country like India, the population density is 300 humans per square kilometer. And in the most population dense country in the world, which is where I come from, or actually I was born in New Orleans, where some of my ancestors came from, which is Bangladesh. So there's a lot of people like me, I guess. In Bangladesh, you have a population density of 900 humans per square kilometer. And to some degree, this is a testament to the fertility of the land and whatever else. But this is pretty near the limits, depending on agricultural productivity and whatnot in the land, of modern technology. So it really makes you think, if you don't get population under control, you might end up with some of these kind of hitting the wall type of scenarios. And so the last thing I want you to think about, and this is what I refer to a little bit more, is just think about those two dimensions, because sometimes they get a little bit muddled. One is the kind of the productivity of land, productivity of land. And then the other is the productivity of labor, productivity of labor. So right over here in a hunter-gatherer, they're not getting money calories from their land, so they're right over there. And the humans have to do all the labor. They don't have animals helping them in any way. They definitely don't have robots or any type of engines helping them in any way. And so they have to spend a lot of human time and a lot of human labor doing the work, getting that productivity from the land. But as we progress, so as we progress with things that aid humans, so for example, if all of a sudden you have cattle helping you or you have other tools that help you, you get more human productivity. So less and less of human labor has to be used to get that productivity of the land. And so maybe other humans can go do other things like paint pictures or become blacksmiths or whatever. And in this direction, you get higher productivity per unit of land. And so that comes from moving from hunter-gatherer to a pastoral lifestyle, to traditional farming with irrigation, to modern farming. And so on this graph right over here, kind of tools for the individuals move us up, getting more productivity of the land move us to the right. Modern agriculture gets us right over here. So we're getting much, much more calories per unit land and we're getting much, much more calories per unit labor. So you need a much smaller percentage of the human population actually involved in the farming. Anyway, I'll let you go there. Hopefully that gives you at least an understanding that food doesn't just come from nowhere and it really is a rate-limiting factor on humanity's population."
0a93189e-f211-4347-abe3-f95d1e24b4a3,"That dream about the dinosaur and the leotard. Those times that you said that thing that you know you shouldn't have said, or even that thing you didn't even know you were gonna say. The little cogs of your consciousness cranking away, making your life possible, making society function, all of the things that you're so glad you can do, and all of the ones you wish you could stop doing. Excluding other human minds, your mind is the most complicated piece of the universe that humans currently know about. The rules that govern it are mysterious and elusive. Maybe our brains just aren't complex enough to understand themselves. But that's not gonna stop us from trying. The word psychology comes from the Latin for the study of the soul. And while its formal definition has evolved over the last several decades, today we can safely call it the science of behavior and mental processes. The term psychology wasn't coined until around the turn of the 16th century, and a practice that we would actually call science today wasn't established until the mid-1800s. But of course, humans have always been curious about themselves and what's going on up here. Aristotle pondered the seed of human consciousness and decided that it was in the heart, not the head, being, as we have seen quite a lot here on Crash Course, absolutely and completely wrong. Two thousand years ago, Chinese rulers conducted the world's first psychological exams, requiring public officials to take personality and intelligence tests. And in the late 800s, Persian doctor Muhammad ibn Zakaria al-Razi, also known as Razi's, was one of the first to describe mental illness, and even treated patients, in what was essentially a very early psych ward in his Baghdad hospital. From the efforts of those early thinkers up until today, the field of psychology has been all about tackling some of the big questions. How can humans do horrible things, like commit genocide and torture other humans, and how come we know those things are horrible? Do we have free will, or are we simply driven by our environment, biology, and non-conscious influences? What is mental illness, and what can we do about it? And what is consciousness, or the notion of self? If I lose my awareness of myself, am I still human? I don't know! But over the next six months, these are the questions that we're going to be exploring together. How our brains work, how they can break, how they can be healed. Why we behave the way we do, even when we don't want to. And what it means to be thinking, and feeling, and alive. INTRO When hearing the word psychology, most people probably think of a therapist listening to a patient unpacking the details of his day while reclining on a couch. Maybe that therapist is wearing glasses, chewing on a cigar, stroking his whiskered chin. Admit it, if you're thinking about psychology, you're probably picturing Freud. Sigmund Freud was one of the most tremendously influential and controversial thinkers of his time, maybe of all time. His theories helped build our views on childhood, personality, dreams, and sexuality. And his work fueled a legacy of both support and opposition. His life was long, and spanned an important swath of history from the American Civil War to World War II. But like most great scientists, Freud developed his revolutionary ideas by building on the work of others. And, of course, innovation in the field didn't stop with him. In truth, psychology is one of the most wildly diverse sciences, in terms of the questions it proposes, the methods it applies, and the different schools of thought and disciplines it contains. Perhaps more than any other science, psychology is just a big ol' integrated melting pot. For instance, right around Freud's time, there were a lot of different schools of thought about how the study of the human mind should be tackled. Mainly, there were the ideas of structuralism, functionalism, and psychoanalysis. Scientific psychology got its start in 1879 in Germany, when physician Wilhelm Wundt set up the first psychology laboratory at the University of Leipzig, just a few years after publishing his Principles of Physiological Psychology, considered the first true psychology textbook. Wundt and his student Edward Bradford Titchener took cues from chemists and physicists and argued that if those people could break down all matter into simple elements or structures, why couldn't they do the same for the brain? They tried to understand the structures of consciousness by getting patients to look inward, asking them how they felt when they watched a sunset, or smelled a coffee, or licked a kitten, or whatever. Titchener named this approach structuralism. But despite its rigid-sounding name, it really relied so much on introspection that it became too subjective. I mean, you may sense and feel something different than I do, even if we lick the same kitten. Psychologists, of course, can't actually observe a patient's inner thoughts or feelings, so ultimately the structuralist school of thought was fairly short-lived. By contrast, American physician and philosopher William James proposed a different set of questions focusing on why we think, and feel, and smell, and lick, or whatever. Basically, he focused on the function of behavior. This approach, functionalism, was inspired by Charles Darwin's idea that adaptive behaviors are conserved throughout the evolutionary process. James published his seminal book, The Principles of Psychology, in 1890, defining psychology as the science of mental life. Just as Freud was starting to flex his big brain. Sigmund Freud began his medical career at a Viennese hospital, but in 1886, he started his own practice specializing in nervous disorders. During this time, Freud witnessed his colleague Josef Breuer treat a patient called Anna O. with a new talking cure. Basically, it just let her talk about her symptoms. The more she talked and pulled up traumatic memories, the more her symptoms were reduced. It was a breakthrough, and it changed Freud forever. From then on, Freud encouraged his patients to talk freely about whatever came to mind, to free-associate. This technique provided the basis for his career, and an entire branch of psychology. In 1900, he published his book, The Interpretation of Dreams, where he introduced his theory of psychoanalysis. Now, you probably think of psychoanalysis as a treatment, the whole patient-on-the-couch scenario, and that's definitely part of it. But Freud's concept was actually a lot more complex than that, and it was revolutionary. The radical kernel of psychoanalysis was the theory that our personalities are shaped by unconscious motives. Basically, Freud suggested that we're all profoundly affected by mental processes that we're not even aware of. Now, that sounds almost obvious to us now, but part of the genius of Freud's theory was that in 1900, it wasn't obvious at all. The idea that our minds could be driven by something that our minds themselves didn't know about was hard to grasp. As hard as, like, maybe organisms evolving by natural selection. It was abstract, invisible, and there was something about it that seemed irrational. But the other important part of Freud's theory was that the subconscious, literally the thing below consciousness, was still discoverable. Even though you weren't aware of it, you could come to understand it through a therapeutic technique that used dreams, projections, and free association to root out repressed feelings and gain self-insight. So what Freud was really saying was that mental disorders could be healed through talk therapy and self-discovery. And this was a really big breakthrough, because prior to this, people with mental illnesses would be confined to sanatoriums and, at best, given menial labor to do, and at worst, shackled to a bed frame. After The Interpretation of Dreams, Freud went on to publish over 20 more books and countless papers, with an iconic cigar in hand all the while. He believed smoking helped him think, but it also helped him get jaw cancer. During the last 16 years of his life, he underwent at least 30 painful operations, while continuing to smoke. By the late 1930s, the Nazis had taken over Austria, and Freud and his Jewish family narrowly escaped to England. By September 1939, the pain in his cancerous jaw was too great, and a doctor friend assisted him in suicide through morphine injection. He was 83. Whether you love him or hate him, and make no mistake, plenty of people vehemently disagreed with him. There's no question that Freud's impact on psychology was monumental. While competing theories in the young field of psychology either fell away or evolved into something else, psychoanalysis remains an important concept and practice today. The next big shake-up rolled in during the first half of the 20th century, when behaviorism gained a higher profile. Heavy hitters like Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and B.F. Skinner were key players here. They focused on the study of observable behavior. You may remember Skinner as the dude who put rats and pigeons and babies in boxes and conditioned them to perform certain behaviors. Right around when Freud escaped to England, Skinner published his Behavior of Organisms, ushering in the era of behaviorism, which remained all the rage well into the 1960s. The other major force at the time was, of course, Freud's psychoanalysis, and its many descendants, collectively known as the psychodynamic theories. These focused on the importance of early experiences in shaping the unconsciousness, and how that process affects our thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and personalities. By the mid-20th century, other major forces in psychology were also brewing. Examples we'll explore later in this course, including humanist psychology, which focuses on nurturing personal growth, cognitive science, and neuroscience, all of which contributed their own unique takes on the study of mind. Today's formal definition of psychology, the study of behavior and mental processes, is a nice amalgamation that pulls from all these different schools of thought. It recognizes the need for observing and recording behavior, whether that's screaming, crying, or playing air saxophone to an imaginary audience. But it also gives credit to our mental processes, what we think, and feel, and believe, while we're tearing it up on our invisible instruments. Because again, the point that I really want you to take home is that psychology is an integrative science. Yes, folks still get grumpy and disagree plenty, but the essence of the discipline has everything to do with creating different ways of asking interesting questions, and attempting to answer them through all kinds of data-gathering methods. The human mind is complicated. There is no single way to effectively crack it open. It must be pried at from all sides. Harvard astronomer Owen Gingrich has gazed into the distant horizons of space, and even he has acknowledged that the human brain is by far the most complex physical object known to us in the entire cosmos. And we all get to have one, of our very own, knocking around right up in here.

d45768af-f57e-4159-8779-44e1783e600b,"There are many things that differentiate human beings from other species. But the one thing that probably differentiates humans, even from our closest relatives in the animal kingdom, in a really big way is the notion that humans are collective learners. And to understand that, let's think about how even our closest relative in the animal kingdom, the chimpanzee, might communicate. So you might have one chimpanzee. And over the course of his or her lifetime, they are able to learn a bunch of cool experiences. And they're even able to learn to use tools, manipulate tools, and who knows, maybe even make tools. Maybe even get a twig someplace and take off the leaves and then use that to go get ants out of a hole or whatever else. So they're able to learn all of this stuff over a lifetime. Now, unfortunate for chimpanzees, well, what is fortunate for chimpanzees is they do teach some of these things that they've learned to other members of their group, often their offspring. But what's unfortunate for chimpanzees is they don't have a great way to communicate with each other. So for most chimpanzees, the way that they're able to teach is essentially by kind of showing, not showing and telling, just showing. And so because this is such an imprecise or not exact and such an inefficient way of communication, they're really all of the nuances of what this chimpanzee might be able to accumulate over his or her lifetime aren't able to be conveyed to the next generation or to the other chimpanzees around. So you have tremendous energy loss. And in particular, all that can be conveyed are maybe the specific movements or what you might be able to kind of observe in the present. All of the other things that maybe the chimpanzee is learning about the times of year where this is appropriate. And maybe they can convey some of that by showing them at the right times of year. But other nuanced aspects of it or particular ways to hold something or twist something can only be shown. It can't be described in a very precise way. So you have all of this loss of experience, this loss of information. And then over the course of these animals' life, they may be able to learn the same amount again. They're able to learn maybe the same amount again. But then when they need to communicate it, they have the exact same problem. It's hard to communicate it with what they have at their disposal, which is really just showing the other chimpanzees what they've done. And so once again, you have a loss of information. And what you have in this type of circumstance is generation after generation, even though there is learning over the course of an individual chimpanzee's life, and even though they can communicate some of that to each other, that form of communication loses so much information and so much nuance that you never have an overall accumulation of knowledge and wisdom in this chimpanzee population. Now, humans, on the other hand, have something called symbolic language. And I'll talk about this in a second. But for now, it's safe to say that human language is far more precise and far more efficient than just being able to show someone something. Imagine if you had to learn how to do something without being able to communicate verbally, if you just had to look at someone else's actions. And then you'd have a good idea of how difficult it is for chimpanzees to teach each other. But in the case of human beings, we have this thing called symbolic language that's a very precise, a very efficient way of communicating. So from one human being to another, you can actually communicate a good deal, maybe not every single nuance and every single experience, but a good chunk of it. So right here, I'm drawing about that much of it to some other human being. Maybe it is the offspring. Maybe it is another member of the tribe or the group or whatever it is. And then this human being might come up with some other innovations. They're able to build off of all of this learning from that previous generation or from that other human being that's around. And they're able to come up with their own nuances and their own innovations. And this one right over here might come up with his or her own nuances and innovations. And because they have a good communication mechanism, this one could even communicate to that one what he's learned or what she's learned and communicate a good chunk of that. Maybe not all of it, but maybe a reasonable bit. They can describe exactly how they do something, the times of years, when it's good to do it, when it's not good to do it, how to plan for the future, what's the history of this new learning. And so what you have going on here is because of this strong communication mechanism, so strong, precise, efficient communication, what you have is a human group, or eventually a human civilization, is able to have a collective memory. In the case of the chimpanzees, every generation, every chimpanzee is having to relearn the things that the other chimpanzees might have already done in previous generations. They're not able to really move forward or build on those in significant ways. In humans, as information is learned and experience gained, a good bit of that is able to be passed on to other humans. And so this might be passed on. So all of this might be passed on, or a good chunk of this could be passed on to the next generation. And I'm not even talking about written language yet. This could still just be oral communication, which is still a very strong, precise, efficient means of communication. Written communication takes it to another level. But then this person over here, maybe she comes up with other innovations. And at some point, you might say, well, look, if everyone keeps having innovations and they keep learning what everyone learned in previous generations, maybe this will tap out the total amount of memory that a human being even has. And there's actually a case that maybe this is one of the reasons why humans even have larger memories. Because there is all of this collective knowledge to gain from one generation to another, from one human being to another. But there are some limits to this. And this is the other element where this collective aspect of collective memory and collective learning becomes really powerful. A human being, because of the strong communication mechanism, is not just limited to the knowledge and the experience in their memory. They are able to tap into. So this human being right over here does not have this skill set. And that skill set maybe gets passed on to another human being. So let me copy and paste that. So let's say you copy and let's say you paste that. This other human being that's maybe living at the same time. And when that becomes relevant, they could actually tap into it. And maybe they could learn it from that human being. Or maybe it's in a different part of society. And this human being can build certain tools or build certain things using this information, using that knowledge right over there. And then this human being doesn't need to know that information. They can just leverage the output of that information to then build on top of it. So what it allows human beings to do is not only convey information and build on information from generation to generation, human to human, it allows all of the human brains collectively at any given point of time to be one collective memory bank that can be used to develop or innovate in specific domains and adapt to specific parts of the ecosystem or to teach each other. So all of a sudden, this is really unique, as far as we can tell, in the animal kingdom. All of a sudden, it's not all about the brain or the memory of one individual member of a species. It now becomes about the brain or the memory of the entire civilization or the entire group of the species. And just as an example of that, there's, as far as I know, there's no human being who knows how to do everything that all human beings know how to do. I could imagine that there is a chimpanzee that knows how to do everything that any other chimpanzee knows how to do. There are no humans that can be a fighter pilot, a doctor, a gymnast, a lawyer, understands philosophy, speaks 20 different languages. As far as I know, that human being does not exist. And that's OK, because they can tap into the experiences, the abilities of other human beings to build up their civilization. None of us, as far as we know, knows how to do everything that we need to actually build our civilization. But the information is in our collective memory to actually do it. Now, the next thing you might say is, OK, I started with this premise that we have a strong, precise, efficient means of communication and that other animals don't. But don't other animals actually have some form of language? So for example, even monkeys, when they screech, when they are in danger, that's a form of communication, maybe a form of language. Maybe certain animals, birds, monkeys, maybe they have a song that they sing that can convey certain things. Maybe it's when they are looking for a mate. Isn't that a form of communication? And these are. These are a form of communication and a form of language. But these don't really come in play in terms of the teaching learning. You don't see one chimpanzee making screeching sounds or learning sounds. They might do a little bit just to warn, maybe as a warning. But there's no deep nuance or deep precision that's being able to convey by these one-off sounds or even one-off gestures. And what's particularly powerful about human language is that it is a symbolic language. And when I say it's a symbolic language, I'm even saying it in a broader sense than even just written symbols. I'm talking about even the sounds themselves. So let's go to a time where we did not even have writings. And when we talk about symbolic languages, let's think about a non-symbolic language. So in a non-symbolic language, you might have some sound. Let's call it sound one. And it has some meaning. Let's call it meaning one. So this might be a certain type of scream. It means that a predator is approaching. Then you might have something like a sound two or gesture two. And then it has some other meaning. It has meaning two. It might be a certain type of song, which means that I am in the mood to reproduce or whatever else. You might have gesture three that has some direct meaning. It might mean that I have found food or something like that. So meaning three. What humans have, they can do this, where particular sounds have particular meanings. For example, in humans, you could have sound one. It refers to meaning one. I'll just refer it to meaning one. You could have sound two that refers to meaning two. You could have sound three that refers to meaning three. So these are just direct representations. But what is really powerful about symbolic languages is that these oral symbols can be combined according to set rules or grammars to have an infinite number of meanings. So this is what really makes human language transcend other languages and really makes it this robust, precise communication mechanism, is you could have combinations. Sound one, sound two, sound three will now have another meaning, meaning four. Then you could maybe have a combination where you have sound three, sound one, and sound two might have meaning five. And if you have tens of thousands of sounds, when really our oral words are those sounds in a given language, then all of a sudden, you can have infinite meanings by putting them in different combinations. And if you think this is a little bit abstract, imagine that sound one is the sound me saying the word dog. And I'm not even going to write it down because I want to imagine a world even before written communication. So sound one is the sound dog. Sound two is the sound eats. And sound three is the sound man. So literally, sound one, if you heard dog, you'd think, OK, I'd visualize a dog of some type. And even there, you'd have some visualization of a dog. And we all have one, maybe. Sound two, if you heard eats, you'd say, OK, I imagine eating in some way. And sound three, man, you have some visualization of it. And if it was a non-symbolic language, that's all you could get out of those three sounds. But now in a symbolic language, we can combine those. We could say dog eats man. So once again, we just reused the three sounds, the three symbols. But now they're referring to a whole new, much more complex meaning than just referring to certain objects or certain actions. Or you could have man eats dog. It's not pleasant, but I guess in a desperate situation. But once again, it is another meaning that we can get out of the same sounds. And what these symbolic languages do, besides giving you an infinite number of meanings, they're allowed to give you more nuance and really refer to things that are abstract, including, and maybe most importantly, things like the present, the future, the past, kind of hypothetical things that really are necessary in order to really communicate or optimally communicate all of the experiences or the learnings from one entity to another."
e5031386-5f5e-420a-89f5-28091ac3c298,"Now that we've figured out the total revenue given any quantity, and we've also been able to express it algebraically, I want to think about what the marginal revenue is at any one of these points. And to think about marginal revenue is just how much does our total revenue change given some change in our quantity? And then later we can use that so that we can optimize the profit for our monopoly over here. And I'm going to try to do it without calculus. It actually would be very straightforward to do it with calculus because we're essentially just trying to find the slope at any point along this curve. But I'll try to do it algebraically, and maybe it'll even give you a little intuition for what we end up doing eventually in calculus. So the first thing I want to do is essentially find the slope right over here. And the best way to find the slope right over here is say, well, how much does my total revenue change if I have a very small change in quantity? So if I have a very small change in quantity, how much does my total revenue change? So let me think about it this way. And the other ones I will be able to approximate a little bit easier. So let's think of it this way. If my quantity is 0, my total revenue is 0. That one's easy. If I increase my quantity very, very, very, very little, so let's just make it 0.001, what is going to be my total revenue? And we could think about it in terms of this curve right over here, or we could just use this expression, which we derived from price times quantity. And we will get my calculator out. If our quantity is 0.001, our total revenue is going to be negative. Let me turn the calculator on. Total revenue is going to be negative 0.001 squared. So that's that part. Plus 6 times 0.001. So that's going to be our total revenue. So it's going to be 0.005999. So it's 0.00599. And so now we can figure out or get a pretty good approximation for that marginal revenue right at that point. Our change in quantity is 0.001. So our delta Q, this right over here, is 0.001. That's our change in quantity. And our change in revenue is 0.00599. And so we just have to divide 0.005999, that top one, our change in total revenue, divided by our change in quantity. Divided by 0.001. And we get 5.99999. And if you try it with even smaller numbers, if you tried this with 0.000001, you'll get 5 point and you'll get even more 9s going on. So the closer that you get, the smaller your change in, and this is what you essentially do in calculus, you try to find a super small change right over here. This is essentially going to be 6. Our marginal revenue at this point is essentially going to be 6. So what I want to do is I want to plot marginal revenue here on our demand curve as well, or on this axis where we've already plotted our demand curve. So when our quantity is 0, our marginal revenue, if we just barely increase quantity, the incremental total revenue we get is going to be 6. So I'll just plot it right over there. And that makes sense. The marginal benefit in the market is 6 right at that point. So if we were to just sell a drop of orange juice, or I guess we're selling oranges in this case, not juice, but if we were to sell a millionth of a pound of oranges, we would get the equivalent of roughly $6 per pound for that millionth of a pound, because that's the marginal benefit for that very first incremental chunk of orange out there in the market. So it makes complete sense. Now let's think about the slope at these other points. And these I'm going to approximate. I could do it this way, but I'll just approximate it by using other points. So if I want to find the slope right over here, when our quantity is equal to 1, the slope would look like that. And I'm going to approximate it by finding the slope between these two points. I'm going to approximate it, and actually it's going to be a very good approximation. I'll do it later with calculus to show that it is a very good approximation. But I'm going to approximate it by the slope between these two points. And between those two points, our change in quantity is 2, and our change in total revenue is 8. Our change in total revenue is 8. When we produced 2, our total revenue, or 2,000 pounds, our total revenue was $8,000. So we have a change in total revenue of 8, or 8,000 I guess we could say, divided by a change in quantity of 2,000. So our marginal revenue at this point is 8 divided by 2, or 8,000 divided by 2,000, which is $4 per pound. So when our quantity is 1, our marginal revenue is $4 per pound. It is $4 per pound, just like that. Now let's think about the marginal revenue when our quantity is 2. And to do that, I'm going to find the slope between these two points. We really want to find the slope of that line, but it looks like the slope between these two points is a pretty good approximation. It's actually almost an exact number because the way that this is just a parabola, so we can actually do this. But anyway, this is fairly straightforward. Once again, our change in quantity is 2, and our change in total revenue is, we're going from 5 to 9, which is 4. This was 9 right over here from the last video. Or you could say it's $4,000 divided by 2,000 pounds gives you $2 per pound. So our marginal revenue right over here, if we have quantity of 2, is $2 per pound. Right at that point, for that incremental millionth of an ounce that we're going to sell of oranges, we're getting the equivalent of $2 a pound of increased total revenue from doing that. And let's just do one more point here. I think you'll see why I'm only going to do one more point. If we try to go up here, and we try to figure out what is the marginal revenue, or if we essentially say what is the slope there, how much do we get an increase in revenue if we just barely increase our quantity? And this is actually easier to look at. This is a maximum point right over here in the calculus terms. The slope up there is 0. We can even see that by approximating the slope between the slope between these two points. We have some change in quantity, but we have no change in total revenue. So right at that point, right over here, the slope is barely positive. Right at that point, the slope is 0. And then right past it, it becomes barely negative. But right at that point, our marginal revenue is 0. So when our quantity is 3,000 pounds, our marginal revenue is 0. And then after that, our marginal revenue gets negative. Over here, our marginal revenue gets more and more negative. But something very interesting happens. When we plot our marginal revenue curve, or our line in this case, we are getting a line that is twice as steep as our demand curve. And this is actually generalizable. If we have a linear demand curve like this, it can be defined as a line, then your marginal revenue curve for the monopolist will also be a linear downward-sloping curve, or downward-sloping line, and it will have twice the slope. So this slope over here was negative 1. This slope over here is negative 2. For every increase in quantity, the price goes down by 2. Increase in quantity, price goes down by 2. Increase in quantity, price goes down by 2. So this is marginal revenue. And let's remind ourselves. You know, we were doing all of this algebra and all of this math here. What is marginal revenue telling us? This was the demand curve. It tells us for any given price, what quantity is demanded, or for any given quantity, what is the incremental marginal benefit, or I guess what's the price at which they could sell that quantity. From that, we were able to figure out the total revenue as a function of quantity. And from that total revenue, we were able to say, well, look, at any of these quantities, if we were to increase a little bit more, if we were to increase quantity a little bit more, how much is our revenue increasing? And so obviously, we want to keep increasing quantity while our revenue is, well, while the marginal revenue we get is larger than our marginal cost. And I'll take that up in the next video."
1a35990b-a64c-4eb7-9296-2202fc9bdaaa,"Before we dive deep into our study of government and politics, it's worth asking a fundamental question, and that's whether we even need government or why do we need government. And I encourage you to pause this video and think about this. Do you think we need government and why or do you think we don't need government and why? Okay, now let's start to reason through this a little bit and start to think about the benefits or the pitfalls of a government. So let's say that we are in a world without a government. And this is me right over here. And at first it sounds pretty good. I have unlimited rights here. There's no one infringing on my right. I can say what I want. I have the freest possible speech. There are no laws that I could break. I have the freest possible religion. I have no government telling me what to practice or what I can't practice. I have, I can own what I want. I have property. I can go anywhere. So I have movement. And I also have some freedoms that those of us who live in a government don't typically have. So I would have the freedom to tax others or to take from others, take property. If I'm stronger than them or if I'm just sneakier, I go in the middle of the night, I can just take their property from them. I could just settle on their land. I could have the freedom to punish others or imprison others if I don't like them. It doesn't even have to be for a reason. This is a freedom that most of us don't have in the world that we live in today. But without a government, I would have this freedom, this freedom to go and take stuff from others and to do physical harm or imprison them or enslave them. Now this might sound good to you as an individual, but remember, everyone in this governmentless society would have these same freedoms. And I especially like the ability to have my own property and to have my own freedom of movement. But what if this person right over here doesn't like me to have freedom of movement and so they say, they're going to invoke, look, I can punish or imprison you because I don't like you. And so they're going to infringe on my freedom of movement by imprisoning me. Or maybe I might do it to someone else. And so even though you have all of these freedoms, because everyone else does, especially these latter few, they might be able to take some of these from you, including your freedom to live, your health, your happiness. And this is well-described in political philosophy. In particular, you have a gentleman by the name of Thomas Hobbes who's considered one of the fathers of political philosophy. And this is what he had to say about this state of nature. As long as men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in the condition known as war. And it is a war of every man against every man. In war, the two chief virtues are force and fraud. I can do something by physical force or I could trick you or I could sneak around you and take something from you or imprison you. A further fact about the state of war of every man against every man, in it, there is no such thing as ownership, no legal control, no distinction between mine and thine, between mine and yours. Rather, anything that a man can get is his for as long as he can keep it. In such a condition, every man has a right to everything, even to someone else's body. As long as this continues, therefore, that is, as long as every man continues to have this natural right to everything, no man, however strong or clever he may be, can be sure of living out the time that nature ordinarily allows men to live. This was written in Leviathan, which was published in 1651. So he's framing the same thing. If everyone has a right to everything, well, they can infringe on other people, including their life, their health, their happiness, their freedom to movement. Now, some of you might be skeptical of this. You might say, look, humans are fundamentally good. If you give them that freedom, they have a conscience, they're not going to try to do this to other people. But some of you might be able to cite times in society where there's more of an anarchy, where actually people might devolve. And even if one or two or three, or even if a majority of the people have a conscience and aren't willing to imprison others and punish people arbitrarily, if even a few people are not willing to respect other people's rights, everything might devolve. And it's worth talking about the historical context here, because this was near the end of the English Civil War, where there was chaos, where people were asking these questions, well, what type of government should we have? And when there isn't a strong government, all of this chaos is really all about person versus person. It wasn't this degree of chaos that Hobbes is writing about, this kind of natural state without government, but this was a context where there was a lot of bloodshed, a lot of war, and a lot of chaos. Now, Hobbes had a solution, and this is actually why the book was called Leviathan. He was an advocate of a very strong central government. This keeps people in awe, alludes to what he's thinking of. Leviathan comes from the Old Testament, or the Hebrew Bible. It's the name of a sea monster. But Hobbes thinks that a government should be a leviathan to keep everyone in check. He wrote, when a man thinks that peace and self-defense require it, he should be willing, when others are too, to lay down his right to everything, and should be contented with as much liberty against other men as he would allow other men against himself. Now, this idea that he's talking about, this is today referred to as a social, social contract. And this term, social contract, is first formally used by Rousseau, another Enlightenment author, about 100 years later, talking about this willingness to give up some rights in order to protect the ones that you really, really, really wanna have. And you would be giving up those rights to some form of a government. That is the social contract between the people that are governed and the government that governs them. So going back to that previous example where every person was out for themselves, what the social contract is saying is, well, look, certain of these rights I really wanna keep, my freedom of speech, my freedom of property, my freedom to move around, my freedom to have my life, my health, my happiness, in order to protect those freedoms, maybe I'm willing to give some of my other freedoms over to a central authority as long as everyone is willing to give these up. And this central authority that we give it up to is a government. And the government, because it has this, it uses these rights in order to protect the other rights, the ones that I really want to keep. So the government enforces these other rights, and that's the social contract. I give away these rights in order to protect the ones that I really, really care about. And that makes sense, but it still leaves a very, very big question. What form should this government take? I'm willing to engage in this social contract, but how does this government govern? How are the leaders selected? What are the constraints on that government? And that will be our focus as we study government and politics."
4588d5e3-ecf1-4ee9-9bad-3074c69c60cd,"Say it's late at night, you're home alone, drifting off to sleep, just entering that dream about Fritos, and then suddenly there's a banging at the door. Suddenly, you're wide awake, and it feels like your heart's gonna explode. You jump up, ready to run out the back door, possibly grab a Phillips head screwdriver and stab it into the darkness until it sticks into something. Now whether it's a weeping angel or your neighbor looking to borrow a can of beans, it doesn't really matter, because when you heard that sudden noise, your startled brain released an icy typhoon of chemicals. And everything that's now going through your mind, like your urge to flee, your urge to defend yourself, that internal debate about whether weeping angels are even real, and well, where's the cat? All that? It's just the result of those chemicals. Our brains and our nervous systems and the substances they produce in our always bathed in, our amazingly complex, nuanced systems. And even though we're always talking about our mental activity as being somehow separate from all the biological stuff going on in our bodies, in reality, the moods, ideas, impulses that flash through our minds are spurred by our biological condition. As psychologists like to say, everything psychological is biological. So one way to understand how your mind works is to look at how the chemistry of your body influences how you think, sense, and feel about the world around you. To do that, we begin at the simplest level, the system with the smallest parts. It's all about the neuron, baby. INTRO Neurons, or nerve cells, are the building blocks that comprise our nervous systems. Neurons share the same basic makeup as our other cells, but they have electrochemical mojo that lets them transmit messages to each other. Your brain alone is made up of billions of neurons, and to understand why we think or dream or do anything, you gotta first understand how these little transmitters work. You actually have several different types of neurons in your body, from ones that are less than a millimeter long in your brain, to ones that run the whole length of your leg. Yes, you have cells as long as your legs, which is nothing compared to the 150 feet the nerve cells of some dinosaurs had to be, I'm getting off topic, sorry. No matter how big a nerve is, they all have the same three basic parts, the soma, dendrites, and axon. The soma, or cell body, is basically the neuron's life support. It contains all that necessary cell action, like the nucleus, DNA, mitochondria, ribosomes, and such. So, if the soma dies, the whole neuron goes with it. The dendrites, as bushy and branch-like as the trees they're named after, receive messages and gossip from other cells. They're the listeners, whispering what they hear back to the soma. The axon is the talker. This long, cable-like extension transmits electrical impulses from the cell body out to other neurons, or glands, or muscles. Whereas the dendrites are short and bushy, the axon fiber is long, and depending on what type of neuron it is, is sometimes encased in a protective layer of fatty tissue called the myelin sheath. It's almost like an insulated electrical wire. The myelin sheath speeds up the transmissions of messages, and if it degrades, as it does with those affected with multiple sclerosis, those signals are degraded as well, eventually leading to lack of muscle control. Neurons transmit signals either when stimulated by sensory input, or triggered by neighboring neurons. Neurons pick up the signal and activate the neuron's action potential, or firing impulse that shoots an electrical charge down the axon to its terminals, and toward the neighboring neurons. The contact points between neurons are called synapses. All those bushy little dendrites are decorated with synapses that almost, but don't quite touch the neighboring axon in the tiniest game of I'm-not-touching-you-of-all-time. They're less than a millionth of an inch apart. And that microscopic cleft is called the synaptic gap. So when an action potential runs down to the end of an axon, it activates the chemical messengers that jump that tiny synaptic gap, flying like that little air kiss and landing on the receptor sites of the receiving neuron. Those messengers are neurotransmitters. Although neurotransmitters slide right into their intended receptors, like a key into a lock, they don't stay bonded to the receiving neuron. They just sort of pop out. Having excited or inhibited the receiving neuron's trigger, then the extras immediately get reabsorbed by the neuron that released them in the first place, in a process called reuptake. Kind of like, here you go, oopsie! So neurons communicate with neurotransmitters, which in turn cause motion and emotion. They help us move around, make jazz, hands, learn, feel, remember, stay alert, get sleepy, and pretty much do everything we do. Some of them just make you feel good, like the endorphins we get flooded with after running ten miles or falling in love or eating a really good piece of pie. We've got over a hundred different kinds of these brilliant neurotransmitters. Some are excitatory and others are inhibitory, and all are good reminders that everything psychological is also biological. Excitatory neurotransmitters rev up the neuron, increasing the chances it will fire off an action potential. Norepinephrine is one you're probably familiar with. It helps control alertness and arousal. Glutamate is another, involved in memory, but an oversupply of it can wig out the brain and cause seizures and migraines, which is why some people are sensitive to all that MSG, or monosodium glutamate, in their ramen. Inhibitory neurotransmitters, on the other hand, chill neurons out, decreasing the likelihood that the neuron will jump into action. GABA, gamma-aminobutyric acid, is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter. And you've probably heard of serotonin, which affects your mood and hunger and sleep. Low amounts of serotonin are linked to depression, and certain classes of antidepressants help raise serotonin levels in the brain. Some neurotransmitters, like acetylcholine and dopamine, play both sides, and can both excite or inhibit neurons, depending on what type of receptors they encounter. Acetylcholine enables muscle action and influences learning and memory. Alzheimer's patients experience a deterioration of their acetylcholine-producing neurons. Dopamine, meanwhile, is associated with learning, movement, and pleasurable emotions. And excessive amounts of it are linked to schizophrenia, as well as addictive and impulsive behaviors. So neurotransmitters are basically your nervous system's couriers. But they aren't the only chemical messengers delivering the news. They've got some competition brewing in the endocrine system. And if you've been through puberty, you know what I'm talking about. Hormones. Like neurotransmitters, hormones act on the brain. And indeed, some of them are chemically identical to certain neurotransmitters. Hormones affect our moods, arousal, and circadian rhythm. They regulate our metabolism, monitor our immune system, signal growth, and help with sexual reproduction. You could say that most of them boil down to the basics, attraction, appetite, and aggression. Whereas neurons and synapses flick on and off, sending messages with amazing speed, the endocrine system likes to take its time, delivering the body's slow chemical communications through a set of glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream, where they're ferried to other tissues, especially the brain. So while the nervous and endocrine systems are similar in that they both produce chemicals destined to hit up certain receptors, they operate at very different speeds. It's like if the nervous system wants to get in touch with you, it sends you a text. But if the endocrine system has a message, it will, like, lick the stamp and put it on and write your address, and then a note, and a pen on paper, and then fold it up and put and mail it to you with the post office. But fast isn't always better, and your body will remember that letter longer than the text. Hormones, they linger. Which helps explain why it takes some time to simmer down after a moment of severe fright or anger. Endocrine systems have a few important hormone-brewing glands. We've got a pair of adrenal glands, snuggled up against our kidneys, that secrete adrenaline, that famous fight-or-flight hormone that jacks up your heart rate, blood pressure, and blood sugar, giving you that tidal wave of energy preparing you to run like heck or punch that charging baboon in the throat. The pancreas sits right next to the adrenal gland and oozes insulin and glucagon hormones that monitor how you absorb sugar, your body's main source of fuel. Your thyroid and parathyroid glands at the base of your throat secrete hormones that regulate your metabolism and monitor your body's calcium levels. If you have testicles, they're secreting your sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone, and if you've got ovaries, they're doing that job. And all those glands are super important, but there is one gland that rules them all, and in the darkness binds them. The pituitary gland. Although it's just a little pea-sized nugget, hidden deep in the bunker of the brain, it is the most influential gland in this system. It releases a vital growth hormone that spurs physical development, and that love hormone oxytocin that promotes warm, fuzzy feelings of trust and social bonding. What really makes the pituitary the master gland is that its secretions boss around the other endocrine glands. But even the pituitary has a master, in the hypothalamus region of the brain, which we will talk more about next episode. So if I managed to scare you, sorry, but I'm illustrating a point. You have no control over being scared, but maybe now you do understand a little more clearly how your nervous and endocrine systems worked together to call the shots. First, the sensory input from your eyes and ears went to your brain, the simplest bits of your hypothalamus, without even letting you analyze it, and we're like, ahhh. And then, that ran down the chain of command from your pituitary to your adrenal glands to the hormone adrenaline to the rest of your body and then back to your brain, which then realized that I was just messing with you and told everybody to just calm down for once. The whole deal is a feedback loop. Your nervous system directs your endocrine system, which directs your nervous system, brain, gland, hormone, brain. And of course, each of these systems is fantastically complex, way more than we can get into here. So in our next lesson, we're gonna get all up in your brain and delve deeper into the different components of your nervous system, find out what your old brain is, and learn about how much of your brain you actually use.

3d826136-a537-4a82-ad75-2ea60e0a4f34,"If we were to rewind the clock back about 70 million years, you would see dinosaurs roaming the Earth. And this is a very nice picture here of a dinosaur enjoying a sunset at the beach. But unfortunately for the dinosaurs, about 65 million years ago, we believe that a huge meteorite struck the Earth and essentially wiped out the dinosaurs. And they probably wiped out a bunch of other species with it, because you can imagine the shock wave itself would just exterminate tons of species. Then you would have the tsunami of unimaginable size that would just envelop the continents for some period of time. And then you would have all of the soot that would go into the air and maybe make it impossible for most of the plant species to live, because it would be blocking out all of the sunlight. And so in an environment like that, we could imagine that an animal like this would be well-suited to survive. It's sitting there underground. Maybe it can hibernate in some way, so it doesn't need food for long periods of time. Maybe it has its own food stash under there someplace. And so we believe that our ancient ancestors, after this mass extinction event, might have been something like this, kind of a mole-looking rodent animal that was protected from all of this craziness that was happening on the surface, because they like to hang out underground and have all their food nearby them, and maybe they could hibernate in some way. So you can imagine once everything settled down, and now we're talking, who knows, hundreds of years, thousands of years, even millions of years, some of this guy's descendants start to poke their head out of the ground. They're like, you know what? There's food in trees, and there's no one else in the trees, and trees are a good place to maybe get away from some of the other predators that have managed to survive this mass extinction event. And some of its ancestors, or some of its descendants, I should say, that were good at climbing trees decide, hey, let's try this tree thing out. And so you started to have some selection for the descendants of this rodent that could climb trees well. They were able to find food where their ancestors couldn't. They could find protection in the trees where their ancestors couldn't. And so you could imagine that some subset of this guy's descendants evolved into something that might have looked like this guy. And all the pictures I'm showing you, these are of modern animals, except for, of course, the dinosaur. I'm sure this was kind of Photoshopped in in some way. This is a modern bush baby, but I show this picture because it could have been what some of these primitive primates looked like. Because a bush baby, it kind of climbs trees. It kind of looks like it's starting to get a hand here to start climbing the trees, but it also has rodent-like qualities. But this is, of course, a modern version of it. So this bush baby's ancient, ancient, ancient ancestor might have been that primitive primate or that species of primitive primate that was a descendant of rodents that started to say, hey, let's see if we can climb these trees and find some food. And then some of its descendants might have had just the right adaptations, found their own little niche in the right ecosystems, and they would have evolved into monkeys. Once again, this is a modern monkey, but you could imagine some type of primitive monkey. And then some of those primitive monkeys' descendants, they turn into these modern monkeys eventually, but some of them, they grow larger in size. They spend more time outside of trees. They lose their tail. They don't need it as much for balance. Maybe it's actually a bad thing to have because someone else could grab it when you're in a fight or something like that. And they evolve into apes, and in particular, the great apes. So one of the great apes, the great apes involve gorillas and chimpanzees, and chimpanzees and the ancestor, or really the great apes also include humanity. So let me just review back on this timeline just so that we don't get confused. I'll review what we just talked about. So before this mass extinction event, 65 million years ago, you had all these types of species here. Maybe this right up here, maybe this was, actually if I'm talking about species, maybe this was Tyrannosaurus rex because the dinosaurs involve a whole bunch of, so this might have been T. rex. And there's a bunch of species that we could list over here. But after that mass extinction event, that was an endpoint for a ton of species except for maybe this primitive rodent mole-like thing that was, you know, maybe a lot of them died in this event, but just enough of them survived because they were underground or just in the right place or they were in a mountain someplace. Who knows where they were. And some of them were able to evolve into primitive primates. And some of those primitive primates, and this is once again, these are pictures of primitive primates. Some of those primitive, and when I say primitive, these are modern versions of them. So primitive doesn't necessarily mean worse because obviously these guys were able to find even in today's world, they have a niche for themselves. They're able to find food and reproduce in ways that, you know, don't get in the way of other people and other way people don't get in the way of them. When I talk about primitive primate, I'm just talking about kind of an ancestral primate, maybe something that's not there today. Although maybe some of its descendants look very much like it. But anyway, some of those primates evolve into primitive monkeys. Some of those primitive monkeys' descendants become modern monkeys. So this is, I'll call it M monkeys for modern monkeys. And some of them evolve into primitive apes. And apes, their distinctive characteristic is that they're like monkeys, but they don't have tails and they're larger than most monkeys. And so these primitive apes, some of their descendants are modern gorillas. At some point, they break off. Some of these descendants are a ancestor of both modern chimpanzees and of human beings. And we think, just looking at the DNA evidence, we think that this departure right here and the fossil evidence was about 7 million years ago. That's our best guess for when we as human beings had a common ancestor with the chimpanzees. Now, you have that common ancestor. Some of that common ancestor's descendants became modern chimpanzees. And some of them, maybe they explored the right ecosystem where it was more advantageous to do so, started to walk on two legs. And the most famous fossil of this is the Australopithecine fossil of Lucy that was discovered 3.2 million years... It was discovered more recently. It's 3.2 million years old. So the whole genus, and genus is kind of one level of categorization above species, the whole genus of Australopithecine, these were 4 to 2 million years ago. 4 to 2. And we never know. You could always find a fossil that's older than this, maybe newer than this. I read one account that says maybe 1 million years ago. But give or take, the Lucy fossil, which is the most well-established Australopithecine fossil, is about 3 million years old. And this is a reconstruction I have over here of Lucy. So this is probably what Lucy looked like. And once again, there were many Lucys. It wasn't just there was one Lucy and we're all descended from Lucys. And it's actually not even clear that we are even descended directly from Australopithecine. We might be a cousin species, or a cousin genus, I should say. Genus is the category right above species. So if you fast forward a little bit more, you go to about 2.3 to 1.4 million years ago. We see fossils that they're standing upright. The brain size is bigger. Because if you look at the Australopithecine fossils, they are standing upright, but their cranial capacity isn't that different than chimpanzees. You fast forward to 2.3 million to 1.4 million years ago, we start to see fossils where they're standing upright still, and the cranial capacity has grown, and you're starting to see primitive stone tools around the bone fossils. And so we believe that these are one of the first, and this is really just how we categorize it, but these are some of the first fossils that we categorize as belonging to the same genus as ours. And the genus is Homo. And Homo just means man. So it's the group right above species of man. And we call them similar to man because it looks like they're starting to make primitive stone tools. They stand upright like us, and they have larger cranial capacities than the Australopithecine fossils or modern chimpanzees. And once again, we don't know if Homo habilis, which literally means, so the Homo part means man, habilis means handy because he liked to, I guess, make tools or whatever else. We don't know if Homo habilis is a descendant of Lucy's species of Australopithecus or maybe a cousin species. Maybe they're both descendants from some common ancestor. We're not quite sure. Then you fast forward a little bit more. We're talking now about 1.8. So now we're talking about 1.8 to 1.3 million years ago. And we start seeing fossils where the cranial capacity, larger than Homo habilis, getting closer in size to what our notion is of a modern person's cranial capacity, at least relative to body size. And this is Homo erectus. And once again, we don't know if Homo erectus is a descendant of Homo habilis. Maybe they have a common ancestor. Who knows? And it looks from the fossil evidence that there was, especially when you look at this range here, that there was some overlap where you had both Homo erectus and Homo habilis living on the same planet at the same time. Now you fast forward even more and we think about 600,000 to 300,000. Once again, all of these are constantly being modified as we get better at finding new fossils or interpreting the fossils we have or we look at DNA evidence or whatever. About 600,000 to 300,000 years ago, you have the Neanderthals appear. And Neanderthals are in the same genus as humans. So it's really Homo neanderthalensis. I always have trouble saying this. So this is still part of Homo. And a common misconception is that the Neanderthals are somehow a more primitive version of humans, that they're somehow cavemen and we're modern men. That's not the case. The belief is that Neanderthals are either a cousin species, we have a common ancestor, or that they're actually a subspecies of human beings. And there's some belief that they might have interbred with Homo sapiens. And maybe some or a good number of us have Neanderthal genes. It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's just something, unfortunately, that Neanderthals just get a bad name because of, I guess, our popular culture, if anything. So this is a drawing of a Neanderthal brain. They actually had a fairly large cranial capacity, although scientists say they kind of make one reason or another why we think that they might have been more primitive than Homo sapien. But who knows? We don't know. We're constantly learning things every day. But of course, the whole point of this is to talk about how humans showed up on this planet. And the first really human fossils we find about 200,000 years ago. And this, remember, we're in the genus Homo, and now we finally found something that looks just like us anatomically, at least. We can't study its behavior and all the rest. And now we get to Homo sapiens. The Homo part, once again, means man. And the sapiens means thinking. So we can debate whether it's an appropriate title for our species, but it's thinking man. So once again, the Neanderthals, they were either a cousin species for a lot of this time, especially once Homo sapiens showed up. And maybe Homo sapiens showed up before this. We just haven't found the fossils yet. They were maybe both inhabiting the same planet. Maybe there was some interbreeding. But the Neanderthals disappeared about 30,000 years ago. These guys disappeared. Maybe some of them kind of got mixed in with the Homo sapiens, started to interbreed with them. Or they might have just been killed off because they were fighting over the same ecosystems. And I've made a little sample here of Homo sapiens just in case, well, I'm assuming most of you watching this video are one, but just in case, here's my little sample. We can debate how representative of a sample of our species this really is."
a268801f-efa3-40b7-86ba-5cdf1c5c33a9,"It's estimated that our galaxy, the Milky Way, has 100 to 400 billion stars. And when you hear a number like that, the obvious question is, are there civilizations on planets that are orbiting any of these stars? And maybe an even more interesting question is, can we detect any of those civilizations? Have they gotten to the level of technological progress like us, that they're emitting electromagnetic waves into space that other civilizations like ours can detect and say, hey, there's someone else out there watching television or using radio or whatever else they might be doing. And so what I want to do in this video is not answer that question. It's a big open question. We don't know the answer. We don't have anywhere near enough information to definitively answer that question. What I want to do is come up with a framework for at least thinking about that question, a way of actually estimating how many detectable civilizations there are in just our galaxy. And there's a formula that you may or may not have heard of called the Drake Equation. And what we're going to do is independently derive our own version of the Drake Equation. It's going to be slightly different, but it's the same thought process. And in a future video, I'm going to maybe reconcile what we come up with with the Drake Equation. And just so you know, the Drake Equation is named for Frank Drake, who is a professor at University of California, Santa Cruz. He first kind of put some structure around this problem, and that's why the formula or the equation has his name. But the equation, it's not an equation that you can apply on a daily basis and get results that you can use to build things. But what it is is structures are thinking around this question of how many detectable civilizations are there in our galaxy. Now to answer this question, I'm going to start a little bit differently than Frank Drake did. He starts with the number of new stars that are born each year. And we'll see that our definitions are actually pretty close to each other. What I want to do is start with the total number of stars. So what we're trying to come up with is, I'll call it N, and this is the number of detectable civilizations in the Milky Way, in our galaxy. And once again, there could be civilizations, looking back at this star field right over here. This star right over here, maybe it has a planet that's in the right place, it has liquid water, and maybe there's intelligent life on that planet. But they might not be detectable, because they aren't technologically advanced enough that they're using electromagnetic radiation, or maybe they just figured out some other way to communicate, or maybe they're beyond using electromagnetic radiation, radio waves and all the rest, to communicate, and so we'll never be able to detect them. We're talking about civilizations like ours, that are to some degree using technology not too different than our own. So that's what we mean by detectable. So let's think about that a little bit. So I like to start with just the total number of stars in our solar system. So let's just start with, I'll call it N star and asterisks, and this is the number of stars in our galaxy. And our best guess, I said, is this is going to be 100 billion to 400 billion stars. We don't even know how many there are. Some of them are undetectable. In the center of our galaxy, it's just a big blur to us. We don't even know what's on the other side of that, and we can't even see all the stars that are packed into the center. So this is our best guess, 100 billion to 400 billion stars. Now obviously, it's going to be a subset of those stars that even have planets. So let's multiply it times that subset. So let's multiply it times the frequency of having a planet. If you're a star, this is the percent chance or the frequency or the fraction of these stars that have planets. So I'll write it this way, fraction that have planets. So if this is 100 billion, and let's say I'm making a guess here, and we're learning more about this every day, there are all these discoveries of exoplanets, planets outside of our solar system. Maybe this is one-fourth. Then we could say, well, that means that 100 billion times one-fourth means that there are 25 billion stars that have planets around them. But that's still not enough to go to civilizations. We also need to think about planets, because a planet could be a planet like Jupiter, and we don't know how life as we know it can survive on a planet like Jupiter or on Neptune or Mercury. It has to have planets that are good for sustaining life, preferably have a rocky core, liquid water on the outside. That's what we think are the ingredients that you need for life. Maybe we're just not being creative enough. That's what we know as life as being. So let's multiply this times the average number of life-sustaining or planets that could sustain life on them. So we don't necessarily know that they're going to have life, but they seem like they're just the right distance from the star, not too hot, not too cold. They have the right amount of gravity, water, all the other stuff, and we still don't know exactly what this means, but this means average number. So given that there's a solar system with planets, what's the average number of planets that are capable of sustaining life? And once again, we don't know this answer. Maybe it's 0.1. It's probably less than 1. For any given solar system that has planets, the average number capable of sustaining life, maybe it's 0.1. Maybe it's more than 1. I don't know. We don't know the exact answer here, but I'll throw out a guess. Maybe it is 0.1. And here, the fraction that have planets, I don't know. I'll throw that out. And once again, I'm just making up these numbers. We really don't know the right answer. This is one-fourth. But if we were to multiply this out, we would have the average number of planets in our solar system that are capable of sustaining life, that are around stars, that have planets, and these planets are capable of sustaining life. Now, and this would give us the total number because this is average per solar system that has planets. This is the total number of solar systems with planets. You multiply it out, total number of planets in our galaxy capable of sustaining life. Now, just because you have liquid water and the right temperature and all of the rest of the ingredients doesn't necessarily mean that you will actually have life happening on your planet. So let's multiply that times the fraction that actually generate life. So this is the fraction that actually have life. And this is actually a very, we don't know this answer. So this is the fraction that have life on them. And this is a really big open question. Maybe if you have the ingredients, maybe almost every planet has life. Maybe it's a frequent thing that's happening in our galaxy and frankly our universe. Or maybe it's a very infrequent thing. Maybe it's just the right kind of freak set of circumstances that just have to happen. I'll throw out a number just for the sake of just to have a number there. Maybe it's one out of every ten planets that have all of the right ingredients for life actually do generate life. My personal guess is probably higher than that given that life seems such a robust and flexible thing that we've been seeing in all sorts of weird circumstances. Actually, let me make it even a higher number than that. So let me make it one half assuming that we have all of the ingredients. So this should tell us essentially how many planets, if we were to multiply all of these, how many planets in our galaxy have had life on them at some point in those planets' lives. The life might have come and gone. It may have destroyed itself through nuclear war or whatever, but this would tell us the number of life planets in our galaxy that have had life on them at at least one point in their history. Now, we care about civilization. So let's multiply this times, if you make all of these, you even get to the point that you have life, we care about, well, do you get intelligent life? So maybe if the asteroid never hit Earth, the dinosaurs would have stayed on Earth and they would have never evolved to the point of generating radios and TVs and telephones and all the rest. So it's kind of a freak circumstance that because they were destroyed, these gaps in the ecosystem developed so that we could emerge and be intelligent and do all of these crazy things like make YouTube videos and all the rest. So let's multiply this times the fraction. If you get all of this, the fraction that actually end up having intelligent life. And maybe this fraction is intelligent life. Intelligent life over here. So intelligent life, this is maybe, I'll throw out a number, one-tenth. And probably in the next video, I'll calculate it all. And this is very important to realize because once again, you could have life. These are all examples of life right over here. This is actually life on our planet, even though this looks quite alien. This is a weevil that kind of looked very close up. But there's all sorts of forms of life, many of which we probably can't even begin to imagine. But what we care is that intelligent life starts to emerge on the planet because only intelligent life has a chance, we believe, of being able to eventually communicate in ways that are detectable by us. Now, I said intelligent life, but maybe not all intelligent life will eventually get to the technological sophistication where they will be using radio waves and electromagnetic radiation to communicate with each other. Maybe we might have stagnated at this stage if the right things didn't happen. So what we need to do now is multiply this. So right here, we would have the number of planets in our galaxy that have had intelligent life on them at some point in their history, maybe not at a time that coincides with ours. But what we want to do is whittle it down even more to the percentage that get to the point that they can develop technology that allows us to detect them. So they're kind of... So let me multiply it times the fraction that are... I'll put a C here for maybe they're using communications, C for communications, that allow us to detect them. So this is detectable, the fraction that are detectable. Now, you might think that we're done. This would give you the total number of civilizations or life forms in our galaxy or the planets that have life forms that developed detectable technologies at some point in their history. Now, it would be nice if civilizations did not kind of be born and then die, but the reality is they do die. They might destroy themselves or whatever, and they might exist for only a small period of time for the history of that planet or the history of that solar system. So in order to make it the number of civilizations that are in existence now, and I'll clarify what now means in the next video because it's really, if we're detecting something from a star that's 10,000 light years away, our now means we're just receiving their signals, which means that they released the signals 10,000 years ago. But what I want to do is, what is the fraction of these whose signals are reaching us right now? And here, I'm going to say, well, what's the average lifespan of a civilization? I'll put that L. Who knows what that is? Maybe 10,000 years. So civilization lifespan. And it's going to be that over the life of the star. So that is over, I'll put a T here, T for the star. So the average lifespan for the star. And I could say the average lifespan for the planet or whatever, but we're assuming that once our star supernovas, you're not going to have any chance for Earth to develop life on it anymore. So maybe this thing up here is 10,000 years, and this down here is maybe 10 billion years. And if you were to multiply all of this out, you should get the number of detectable civilizations in our galaxy right now. I'll leave you there for this video. In the next video, we'll discuss it a little bit more and reconcile it with the more famous version of Drake's equation. And I'll also try to talk about this piece a little bit because I think this might be a little bit confusing, and I'll try to diagram that out a little bit more."
20764f49-10c2-4540-baa1-a456caece362,"Can weak old pizza cause psychedelic hallucinations? Does coffee make you smarter? Or does it just make you do dumb stuff faster? Like much of psychology itself, questions like these can seem pretty intuitive. I mean, people may not be the easiest organisms to understand, but you're a person, right? So you must be qualified to draw, like, some conclusions about other people, and what makes them tick. But it's important to realize that your intuition isn't always right. In fact, sometimes it is exactly wrong, and we tend to grossly underestimate the dangers of false intuition. If you have some idea about a person and their behavior that turns out to be right, that reinforces your trust in your intuition. Like, if I warn my buddy Bob against eating that deep dish pizza that's been in the fridge for the past week, but he eats it anyway and soon starts to wig out, I'm gonna say, Dude, I told you so. But if I'm wrong, and he's totally fine, I probably won't even think about it ever again. This is known as hindsight bias, or the I-knew-it-all-along phenomenon. This doesn't mean that common sense is wrong, it just means that our intuitive sense more easily describes what just happened than what will happen in the future. Another reason you can't blindly trust your intuition is your natural tendency toward overconfidence. Sometimes, you just really, really feel like you're right about people, when actually you're really, really wrong. We've all been there. We also tend to perceive order in random events, which can lead to false assumptions. For example, if you flip a coin five times, you have equal chances of getting all tails, as you do getting alternating heads and tails. But we see the series of five tails as something unusual, as a streak, and thus giving that result some kind of meaning that it very definitely does not have. That is why we have the methods and safeguards of psychological research and experimentation, and the glorious process of scientific inquiry. They help us to get around these problems, and basically save the study of our minds from the stupidity of our minds. So I hope that it won't be a spoiler if I tell you now that pizza won't make you trip, and coffee doesn't make you smart. Sorry. [♪ INTRO MUSIC ♪ In most ways, psychological research is no different than any other scientific discipline. Like, step one is always figuring out how to ask general questions about your subject, and turn them into measurable, testable propositions. This is called operationalizing your questions. So you know how the scientific method works. It starts with a question and a theory. And I don't mean theory in the sense of, like, a hunch that, say, a quad shot of espresso makes you think better. Instead, in science, a theory is what explains and organizes lots of different observations, and predicts outcomes. And when you come up with a testable prediction, that's your hypothesis. Once your theory and hypothesis are in place, you need a clear and common language to report them with. So, for example, defining exactly what you mean by thinking better with your espresso hypothesis will allow other researchers to replicate the experiment. And replication is key. You can watch a person exhibit a certain behavior once, and it won't prove very much. But if you keep getting consistent results, even as you change subjects or situations, you're probably on to something. This is a problem with one popular type of psychological research, case studies, which take an in-depth look at one individual. Case studies can sometimes be misleading, because by their nature, they can't be replicated, so they run the risk of overgeneralizing. Still, they're good at showing us what can happen, and end up framing questions for more extensive and generalizable studies. They're also often memorable, and a great storytelling device psychologists use to observe and describe behavior. Like, say the smell of coffee makes Carl suddenly anxious and irritable. That obviously doesn't mean that it has that same effect on everyone. In fact, Carl has terrible memories associated with that smell, and so his case is actually quite rare. Poor Carl. But, you would still have to look at lots of other cases to determine that conclusively. Another popular method of psychological research is naturalistic observation, where researchers simply watch behavior in a natural environment. Whether that's chimps poking anthills in the jungle, kids clowning in a classroom, or drunk dudes yelling at soccer games. The idea is to let the subjects just do their thing, without trying to manipulate or control the situation. So yeah, basically just spying on people. Like case studies, naturalistic observations are great at describing behavior, but they're very limited in explaining it. Researchers can also collect behavioral data using surveys, or interviews, asking people to report their opinions and behaviors. Sexuality researcher Alfred Kinsey famously used this technique when he surveyed thousands of men and women on their sexual history and published his findings, in a pair of revolutionary texts, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Female, respectively. Surveys are a great way to access people's consciously held attitudes and beliefs, but how to ask the questions can be tricky. Subtle word choices can influence results. For example, more forceful words like ban or censor may elicit different reactions than limit or not allow. Asking do you believe in space aliens is a much different question than do you think that there is intelligent life somewhere else in the universe. It's the same question, but in the first, the subject might assume that you mean aliens visiting Earth and making crop circles and abducting people and poking them. And if how you phrase surveys is important, so is who you ask. I could ask a room full of students at a pacifist club, meaning what they think about arms control, but the results wouldn't be a representative measure of where students stand, because there's a pretty clear sampling bias at work here. To fairly represent a population, I'd need to get a random sample where all members of the target group, in this case students, had an equal chance of being selected to answer the question. So, once you've described behavior with surveys, case studies, or naturalistic observation, you can start making sense out of it, and even predict future behavior. One way to do that is to look at how one trait or behavior is related to another, or how they correlate. Let's get back to my buddy Bob, who seems to think that his refrigerator is actually some kind of time machine that can preserve food indefinitely. Let's say that Bob is just tucked into a lunch of questionable leftovers, pizza that may very well have had a little bit of fungus on it. But he was hungry, and lazy, and so he doused it in sriracha. Suddenly, he starts seeing things. Green armadillos with laser beam eyes. From here, we could deduce that eating unknown fungus predicts hallucination. That's a correlation. But correlation is not causation. Yes, it makes sense that eating questionable fungus would cause hallucinations, but it's possible that Bob was already on the verge of a psychotic episode, and those fuzzy leftovers were actually benign. Or, there could be an entirely different factor involved, like maybe he hadn't slept in 72 hours, or had an intense migraine coming on, and one of those factors caused his hallucinations. It's tempting to draw conclusions from correlations, but it's super important to remember that correlations predict the possibility of cause and effect relationships. They cannot prove them. So we've talked about how to describe behavior without manipulating it, and how to make connections and predictions from those findings. But that can only take you so far. To really get to the bottom of cause and effect behaviors, you're gonna have to start experimenting. Experiments allow investigators to isolate different effects by manipulating an independent variable, and keeping all other variables constant, or as constant as you can. This means that they need at least two groups. The experimental group, which is gonna get messed with, and the control group, which is not gonna get messed with. Just as surveys use random samples, experimental researchers need to randomly assign participants to each group to minimize potential confounding variables, or outside factors, that may skew the results. You don't want all grumpy teenagers in one group, and all wealthy Japanese servers in the other. They gotta mingle. Now, sometimes one or both groups are not informed about what's actually being tested. For example, researchers can test how substances affect people by comparing their effects to placebos, or inert substances. And often, the researchers themselves don't know which group is experimental and which is control, so they don't unintentionally influence the results through their own behavior. In which case, it's called, you guessed it, a double-blind procedure. So let's put these ideas into practice in our own little experiment. Like all good work, it starts with a question. So the other day, my friend Bernice and I were debating. We're debating caffeine's effect on the brain. Personally, she's convinced that coffee helps her focus and think better, but I get all jittery like a caged meerkat and can't focus on anything. Because we know that overconfidence can lead you to believe things that are not true, we decided to do some critical thinking. So let's figure out our question, do humans solve problems faster when given caffeine? Now we gotta boil that down into a testable prediction. Remember, keep it clear, simple, and eloquent so that it can be replicated. Caffeine makes me smarter is not a great hypothesis. A better one would be, say, adult humans given caffeine will navigate a maze faster than humans not given caffeine. The caffeine dosage is your independent variable, the thing that you can change. So you'll need some coffee. Your result, or dependent variable, the thing that depends on the thing that you can change, is going to be the speed at which the subject navigates this giant corn maze. Go out on the street, wrangle up a bunch of different kinds of people, and randomly assign them into three different groups. Also, at this point, the American Psychological Association suggests that you acquire everyone's informed consent to participate. You don't want to force anyone to be in your experiment, no matter how cool you think it is. So the control group gets a placebo, in this case decaf. Experimental group 1 gets a low dose of caffeine, which we'll define at 100 milligrams, just an eye-opener and like a cup of coffee's worth. Experimental group 2 gets 500 milligrams, more than a quad shot of espresso dunked in a Red Bull. Once you dose everyone, turn them loose in the maze and wait at the other end with a stopwatch. All that's left is to measure your results from the three different groups and compare them to see if there were any conclusive results. If the highly-dosed folks got through it twice as fast as the low-dose or placebo groups, then Bernice's hypothesis was correct and she could rub my face in it saying she was right all along. But really, that would just be the warm flush of hindsight bias telling her something she didn't really know until we tested it. Then, because we've used clear language and defined our parameters, other curious minds can easily replicate this experiment and we can eventually pool all the data together and have something solid to say about what that macchiato was doing to your cognition. Or at least the speed at which you can run through a maze. Probably the best tool that you have for understanding other people. Thanks for watching this episode of Crash Course Psychology.

cee808fa-da80-4040-969e-3a25eaf39135,"Homungulus. If you've heard that word, it probably wasn't in the context of psychology. A monster in Dungeons and Dragons, a song by the Moby Giants, the bad guys in Full Metal Alchemist, a novel by James Blaylock. It's Latin for little man, and in psychology, it refers to a kind of sensory map of the human body. A depiction of what we'd look like if each of our parts grew in proportion to how much we sense with them. Witness! Look at this dude. His ham hands could rip off a car door, I mean, like, if he could lift them, which he couldn't. But what does he look like on the inside? This freaky thing illustrates the weighted significance of our sensory receptors. His disproportional hands are monstrous, for example, because we primarily touch the world with our hands, not our elbows, so our hands are extremely sensitive. His mouth, meanwhile, is huge because we also have a ton of sensory receptors in our tongues and lips. It's what we use for tasting food and for sucking face. As we continue our exploration of how we both sense and perceive the world, the homunculus, while kind of freaky, is actually a pretty attractive model for understanding how our bodies interact with the environment. How we smell it with our outsized nose, taste it with our ridiculous Mick Jagger lips, and touch it with our enormous Donkey Kong hands. So join me, as we get to know the hideous little creature within you. INTRO Last week, we talked about the difference between sensation and perception. How sensation is the process by which our senses and brain receive information from the outer world, while perception is how we organize and interpret that information and give it meaning. Like, right now, my sense of hearing is letting me detect sounds, while my brain is processing and interpreting them, allowing me to identify and perceive the individual sounds and determine if they're coming from the radio, or outside, or right behind me. Sound moves in waves that vibrate through a medium, like air. And although they function differently than waves of electromagnetic radiation, including what we think of as light, sound waves also can vary in shape. Short waves have a high frequency and a high pitch, like a plucky violin. Long waves have a low frequency and pitch, like a mournful cello. Sound waves' height or amplitude determine a sound's loudness, which we typically measure in decibels. And just as light waves become electrical impulses that we register with our sight, so too do our ears turn vibrating air into signals that our brains can decipher. While the human ear might not be as elegant as the jackrabbits, or as wild as the long-eared bats, it's actually a pretty incredible organ. Or organs, since we have two of them, which helps give us directional stereophonic hearing. That's the 3D type of hearing that we couldn't experience if we had just one big, freaky ear in the middle of our foreheads. Your outer ear, the part that you can see and pierce and tug on, collects sound waves and funnels them through the ear canal into the middle ear, where they cause your eardrum to vibrate. From there, sound vibrations are amplified by the so-called ossicle bones, which also happen to be the most awesomely named bones in your body, the stirrup, the hammer, and the anvil. From here, those physical vibrations travel to the inner ear, where they bump into the snail-shaped cochlea, and its surrounding fluids get jostled around, causing some of your 16,000 tiny cochlear hair cells to bend. This motion triggers neighboring nerve cells that convert that physical energy into electrical impulses, zipping up the auditory nerve into the auditory cortex, where the brain is like, oh, songbirds, or Elvis, or vengeance, or whatever. And you know what goes great? With a little bit of rockabilly, or revenge? A nice meal. One of the greatest joys in life is enjoying flavors. Whether you prefer casserole or caviar, we all get our tasting done in the same way, starting with our taste buds. Each of our thousands of taste buds contains a sort of pocket-like pore that contains 50 to 100 hair-like taste receptor cells that read food molecules and report back to the brain. That chip is salty. That lemon is sour. Now, everybody used to think that our tongues just detected four distinct tastes. Sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. And you've probably seen a version of this bogus taste map, which incorrectly assigns certain tastes to certain parts of your tongue. But we now recognize a fifth flavor, the savory, meaty, MSGE taste for which there is no English word. It's known as umami. But taste is nothing without smell. Plug your nose in a bite of cold bacon, it's just a mouthful of salt. This is a prime example of sensory interaction, the principle that one sense can influence the other. I'll get back to smell in just a bit, but I want to take a moment to talk about what happens when those sensory interactions get messy. Let's take a little questionnaire, shall we? Do certain words trigger a strong, specific taste in your mouth? Like, does the word kitten taste like candy canes? Has hearing a sound ever made you see a color? Like, does Prince's voice singing Purple Rain actually cause the color purple to flash before your eyes? Do you ever feel like you're being touched when you smell something? Like, does the smell of lilies give you the sensation of touching a cold metal surface? Most of you said no to all of those questions, but at least one of you out there answered yes. And more likely than not, that person has synesthesia, a rare and fascinating neurological condition where two or more senses get wrapped together. This kind of sensory mix-up is involuntary, and it's experienced, without forethought, in a durable and consistent way. Like, the number 7 is always going to taste like coffee, and it's never going to switch to tomato juice. And we're still not sure what causes this phenomenon. One idea suggests that the rogue development of new neural connections may override normal boundaries that typically separate the senses. Another theory suggests that all babies are born with synesthesia, and experience mixed senses until the brain matures and creates separate sense channels, unless they don't, in which case you grow up to be a synesthete. Yet another theory links the condition to wonky neurochemistry, in which the neurotransmitters associated with one function turn off way over in a different part of the brain. Just another example of how the mind is still extremely mysterious. So back to the comparatively boring topic of smells that only smell. Unlike our wave-detecting senses of sight and hearing, our taste and smell are chemical senses. We differentiate the smells of spring lilacs, grilled cheese, and gasoline when airborne molecules travel up the nose and reach the 5 to 10 million receptor cells at the top of each nasal cavity. And yes, that means when you smell poop, there's poop particles in your nose. These receptors send information to the brain's olfactory bulb, then zips it on to the primary smell cortex and parts of the lyndic system responsible for emotion and memory. Unlike our five different taste receptors, or two types of retinal receptors, we don't have specifically differentiated smell receptors. Rather, odor receptors can come together in different combinations. So just like pressing different keys on your keyboard can allow you to form tons of different words, so too can these distinct combinations of activated smell receptors communicate some 10,000 unique smells. But how we feel about a smell and our perception of it is often tangled up in our experiences with that scent. If a beloved grandma baked gingerbread every time we visited, those memories may make you partial to the smell of gingerbread. Even if we can't immediately name the odor, our brains are amazing at storing and recognizing old scents by their associations, which is why you may suddenly feel happy when you walk into a bakery, even before you realize you're thinking of your grandma. The emotional power of smell partly has to do with how our scent circuitry connects to the brain's limbic system, right next to our emotional registry, the amygdala, and our memory keeper, the hippocampus. That's why scents can be so intimately tied with our feelings and memories, and how a whiff of nogchampa can immediately transport you back to eating chips in your freshman dorm room. Smelling, hearing, tasting, seeing, all fantastic, but if there's one thing that popular music has taught us, besides a bunch of really terrible relationship advice, it's that when it comes to our senses, we're all about touching. We got songs about magic touches, and golden touches, invisible and human touches, songs about touching ourselves, touching me, touching you, and even what you can't touch. Touch is extremely important, especially during early development. Baby monkeys that are allowed to see, hear, and smell, but not touch their mamas become extremely distraught. That's just a mean experiment. Premature human babies gain weight faster if they're held and massaged, and some studies indicate that children who didn't receive enough physical attention as infants are at higher risk for emotional, behavioral, and social problems as they grow. Your sense of touch is actually a combination of four distinct skin sensations, pressure, warmth, cold, and pain. If you touch various spots of your skin with something soft, like this anglerfish, you'll feel that you sense different amounts of softness on different parts of your body. Just put that up there. The same goes for a warm mug, or an ice cube, or a needle point. You'll sense that some spots are more or less sensitive to each of the four distinct sensations. Other skin sensations, like tickles, itches, and the experience of wetness, are just variations on those four basic sensations. Ultimately, your sense of touch joins forces with sensors in your bones, joints, and tendons to provide your personal kinesthesis. The way that your body senses its own movement and positioning. You use your kinesthetic sense whenever you walk, dance, swim, or hula hoop. It's what the cops are testing drunk people for when they ask them to touch their noses with their eyes closed. This sense allows you to detect changes in the position of your body without relying on other senses, which is why you can still cha-cha, backstroke, and hula hoop with your eyes closed and your ears plugged. The partner sense to your kinesthesis is your vestibular sense, which monitors your head's position and your balance. This sense of equilibrium is ruled by the pretzel-shaped semicircular canals and fluid-filled vestibular sacs that connect those canals to the cochlea in your inner ear. So, if you spin around a bunch and then suddenly stop, it'll take a minute for that inner ear fluid to return to normal, which is what makes you feel dizzy. That moving fluid is actually fooling your brain into thinking your body is still spinning. It's a good example of how even our normal functioning senses can fool us. Understanding exactly how we get fooled helps us understand how our perceptual system works, which is exactly what we're going to be talking about next time. For now, hopefully you realize that your homunculus is actually kind of beautiful in its own way, because you learned how your sense of hearing, taste, smell, and touch work.

ef2817e8-855e-4c77-abc1-39bedb3cbfda,"In the last video, I've mentioned how I've been asked to make predictions for the year 2060. In the last one, I focused on education. That's obviously what I'm working on now, so I have some opinions about that. But what I want to do in this video is do maybe slightly more broad and wild predictions. And my one prediction I'll make is I'm probably completely not going to predict the real reality of 2060. And probably the really big things to predict I will completely miss. But with that out of the way, it is fun to predict things, so let's give a shot. So the first area that I will predict is what's going to happen in the field of medicine. In particular, I think that the human lifespan is going to increase dramatically. So I'll be conservative and say that the lifespan, the average human lifespan, is going to be, especially in the developed world, and once again, hopefully by 2060, most of the world is developed, the average human lifespan is going to be over 100 years old. And I won't say whether that's going to be a good or a bad thing. There's arguments either way about the proper way to live and what happens to global populations. But if the world is, for the most part, developed and educated, you actually will probably have a lower rate of reproduction, and so you might actually have some space in the world for older people. But this, I think, is there's a very strong chance of this happening because we are starting to understand the molecular basis of aging. It's not a given thing that, because of some form of wear and tear, things have to die after 70 years or 80 years or 90 years, and we're starting to understand the mechanisms and how to maybe improve the repair mechanisms or how to augment it in some way. So I definitely think this is going to happen. I don't know whether it's going to be a positive or negative, but it's likely to happen. The next thing, and this is kind of closely related, this is still biological, is you're going to have a close integration between the digital and the biological. So digital and biological. And once again, I won't make any statement of whether this is a good or a bad thing, but it seems like it's just an extrapolation of the direction we're already going in, digital and biological integration. So already, you're getting more and more in your handheld devices. Imagine when your screen is now no longer in your palm, but it's being projected onto your retina from some little thing, and then eventually you have a direct connection with your retina, and your brain can directly access areas of memory through some biological and digital interface. So I definitely think this is going to happen. This is a big deal, because this is starting to, and I think it's already happening with a lot of what you see around technology, it's really going to reshape what the individual human experience is going to be. We already see people kind of living in virtual realities and playing these immersive games and spending all of their time on social networking platforms. What happens when they're literally plugged in all the time, when almost their cell phone is in the brain? I don't know. I'm not going to comment whether it's a good or a bad thing, but it does look like a trend that's going to keep on going through the next 50 years. Now, if we take that even further, we're talking about a digital and biological integration, but if you go at the extreme, and actually it's probably both of these top two things combined in some way, is that we are learning, and once again, not making a comment whether it's good or bad, it's just an extrapolation of what we're already seeing. We are seeing more and more ability to understand our genome, to molecularly target things, to manipulate actual biology. And so what you have is that you can actually have, let me write this, manipulation of biology. This is, on some level, creepy. It could be creepy or it could be exciting, depending on how it all plays out, but it could do things like augment intelligence, augment human intelligence, which would, if you think about all the progress of society and all the things that are already accelerating, imagine how society will change if intelligence itself is augmented. As someone with a limited intelligence, I can't even imagine what will happen as soon as you do this. And obviously, the more you augment intelligence, the more that you can learn how to augment intelligence and increase lifespan and do digital and biological integration even more. So these things I see as some form of a trend. We'll see how it all plays out, and hopefully it plays out in the feel-good Care Bear version versus some type of crazy society, and we all turn into the Borg in some way. Now the other trend, and these are the things that just popped into my brain today when I pressed record, but the other trend that I think is interesting is some of the things that we've taken for granted in terms of how nations interact with each other, and nation states in particular interact with each other. And just as a kind of an overview, so there's a notion called a nation state. And in everyday language, the word nation and the word state almost means the same thing, but they kind of mean different things if you want to be a little bit more formal about them. That's why people use the word nation state. That's like, to a lot of people, it doesn't mean saying like state, state. The difference between a nation and a state is these are a group of people that feel some type of common identity. It could be a language. It could be a culture. It could be a value system. So this is some kind of common identity, and it often is somehow associated with geography, but it does not have to be associated with geography. It could even be a religion or it could be whatever else. That's what a nation is. A state is a formal governance structure that makes the laws and has the institutions to make society function. Now, a nation state is what most of us live in today because it both has an identity and some type of formal institutions. So a very pure nation state would be someplace like Japan where there's relatively uniform in terms of ethnicity and religion and in terms of culture, and you have that same group of people are governing themselves. In a place like the United States, ethnicity, religion, that's diverse, but what gives identity is a notion of shared values and a notion of maybe a common history or whatever else or a certain kind of world view, and obviously there's a formal state structure. Now, what I think is going to be interesting here, and I actually have no idea how all of this is going to play out, but when you see things like some of the revolutions in the Middle East due to things like people being able to communicate irrespective of the traditional media, I think there's going to be some interesting questions on what happens to the nation state, especially nation states that are able to secure their power by kind of having a bottleneck on access to information, and all of that is, I think, going to change in a very dramatic way as you have more and more integration between people, cross-border communications, when people realize that the people on the other side of the border really aren't that different than themselves. And another interesting thing, even the notion of democracy, and once again, I don't know how it's going to play out, but all notions of representational democracy that we have today are somewhat based on geography. They're somewhat based on geography, and that's because when the major representational democracies came about, that was the best way to represent each other. Hey, let me pick some representatives from our county or from our region, and they'll go elect other representatives, and they'll go to the national government. But now that we have this instantaneous communication with people, you might be able to have different types of a representational democracy, or maybe you could even have more direct democracies. Who knows? Because of things like communication and technology and whatever else. And then the other way that I think nation-states or the way they fundamentally interact is going to change is actually in things like warfare. And once again, already seeing this trend. In particular, I think developed countries are not going to have humans on the front line. No humans. No humans on the front line. And depending on your point of view, this could be a very good thing, or it could be a kind of a scary thing. Because if you have no humans on the front line, and you're already seeing things like this with these predator drones, and you see these robot bomb detectors and things like that, and it doesn't even have to be these big things. There's already a DARPA-funded project to work on miniature insects that could be used as some form of reconnaissance, or you could imagine eventually they could have these little things on them that could knock someone out, or who knows what they do. The exciting thing is that all of a sudden a human won't be there to get shot, and so hopefully military casualties would go down. The scary thing here is if you don't have humans on the front line, nations might be willing to enter into war, especially developed nations. They might not take it as seriously, and so it might be something that they do a little bit more when they're in the mood. And it would actually create a huge disparity between developed and developing nations when this happens, and you already see that to a certain degree. A developed nation, they don't have to put as many humans in harm's way, and it's purely driven by their wealth to have capital that can go, these robots and these drones, and their technological innovation, while in the developing countries they actually would have to use human beings, so their costs would be much, much, much, much higher. So it's an interesting question, and once again, who knows how this plays out, whether it's a good or bad thing in the long term. I think a similar thing with this is I think you're going to see more and more nonlethal weapons, nonlethal weapons, which once again, it's very similar to this. It sounds like it's a good thing. If there's a gun that instead of having to kill someone, it incapacitates them in some way or it stuns them in some way, kind of the classic Star Trek put your phasers on stun things, I guess the scarier version of nonlethal weapons is the threshold for using it becomes much lower. So if a government wants to subject its citizens or subject another group of citizens, it can literally just stun them or it can make them pass out or it can control them in some way. So this could be a little bit scarier. So who knows how all of this plays out. So those are my predictions or things to think about over the next 50 years. These are just the things that happened to jump into my brain today, probably based on some of the science fiction books I've been reading or whatever else, but take them with a huge grain of salt. I don't know if these things are really going to happen or not and I don't know if they're even a good thing or not, but they seem to be a bit of an extrapolation of what we're already seeing."
cec5390d-447c-42f2-9be4-56ee25522509,"This right here is a fresco by Raphael of Plato hanging out with his best student, Aristotle. And you may or may not know that these two fellows, along with Plato's teacher, Socrates, are considered kind of the fathers of Western philosophy. But that's not what this video is about. This is actually just a small little video about different dates, or maybe a better way to think about it, different ways to specify dates or dating mechanisms. And so if you were to look up Plato's birth, you might get either 428 or 427, but we'll go with 428. If you were to look up Plato's birth, you might see it written as 428 BC, or you might see it written as 428 BCE. And the natural question is, well, what's the difference here? They both have a BC, but this one has an E. It's the same year right now. And the answer is that these are referring to the exact same year in history, but the acronyms here do stand for different things. BC literally stands for before Christ. So if the date is written 428 BC, the implication is that this is 428 years before the birth of Christ. We'll see in a second that that's not exactly right, but that's what the implication is. If someone writes BCE, they're saying something very different. The B still stands for before, but the C in CE does not stand for Christ anymore. It now stands for common. And so the CE part is common era, even though it's not referring to Christ anymore. And the intention here is so that it's, I guess, less religious than the term before Christ. It's still kind of putting an importance on Christ's birth, because it's saying that the common era is the time period after the birth of Christ, which we'll see in a second isn't exactly right. But there's essentially the same exact dating scheme, one not directly referring to Christ, one that is directly referring to Christ. Similarly, this right here is a painting of Christopher Columbus. And if you were to look up in history books, when was his first voyage, and when did he first show up in the New World, finding an island in the Bahamas, you would see it written as either 1492 or AD 1492 or 1492 CE. And once again, these are all referring to the same year, just using different acronyms. One of them's a little bit more religious, or more directly refers to Christ, and one is a little less religious. So AD, some people think it refers to after death. It does not refer to after death. Because if you think about it, if you have years before the birth of Christ, and if you started numbering after his death, how would you number the years during his life? So AD does not stand for after death. It stands for Anno Domini, which literally means year, and domini means Lord, or the Lord. So it's the year of the Lord, or the year of our Lord. So it's years since, and one Anno Domini would be the year of Jesus Christ's birth. So not after death, it stands for Anno Domini, but literally the year of our Lord. So years since that Jesus was born, with year one implicitly starting with his birth. And we'll see in a second, that's not exactly right. CE stands for Common Era. Once again, 1 CE is the same thing as AD 1. Sometimes we now write, instead of writing AD 1492, we'll write 1492 AD, all referring to the exact same thing. Now, all of these things refer to, when we say 428 BC, it implies 428 years before the birth of Christ. 1492 AD, that's in the year of our Lord, 1492. It implies 1,492 years since the birth of Christ, but the reality is that we're not really quite sure when Christ was born. So Columbus didn't sail across the Atlantic exactly 1492 years after the birth of Christ. Most historians put the birth of Christ at 7 to 2 BC or BCE, depending on how you want to view it. Remember, BC is before Christ, which is a little ironic because we're talking about the actual birth of Christ. BCE is before the Common Era. And they put his death at 30 to 36 AD, which is 30 to 36 in the year of our Lord, or that's what this stands for, Anno Domini, or in the Common Era, CE. Now, some people, they obviously don't like BC. They don't like the BC AD naming mechanism because it's explicitly referring to Christ. And every year, it makes Christ the central figure in all of history. So they'll say that this is clearly too Christian, and they would prefer the situation, they would prefer the less Christian naming scheme, where you use BCE and CE. But a lot of people would still say, hey, look, OK, you changed, well, you know, first of all, some Christians wouldn't like this, that you removed the direct references to the birth of Christ, or being in the years since Christ's birth. But even here, and they'll say, hey, you've removed it. But even here, some people would complain that although you've made the direct reference, that this is saying before the Common Era and the Common Era, even though you've removed the direct reference, it still makes Christ's birth the central thing in all of history. But this is the convention, whether people like it or not. In order to have the same reference point, it would be too logistically difficult to switch at this time, everyone has essentially settled on this. And it's really just a matter of letters of which naming scheme you pick. But the whole point of this video is that you don't get confused between BC and BCE. You don't think that AD stands for after death, it stands for Anno Domini, the year of the Lord, or the year of our Lord. And CE stands for Common Era. But this and this are referring to essentially the same count after the birth of Christ, or this theoretical birth of Christ, which we don't really know when it actually happened. It probably did not happen at the beginning of 1 AD or 1 CE. And these two things both also refer to the same direction in the timeline. One last thing I want to point out is that there is no year 0. So if you take either of these naming schemes, you have, so let's go very close to the year 1. So there's just some point, this theoretical birth of Christ, which was probably not the actual birth of Christ, but at that theoretical point, right at that, so new years, so you have kind of December 31 of the previous year, all of a sudden now you are on January 1 of 1 AD or CE, depending on how you want to refer to it. And the year before that was 1 BC or BCE, depending on how you want to refer to it. So there is no year 0 in this scheme. And then the last thing I want to emphasize, and it might be obvious to you, is the larger a number you have here, the further back you're going in time. Because this is saying how many years before this theoretical birth of Christ. And obviously larger numbers you have here, this is the further you're going off into the future. And if you wanted to figure out how many years passed between Plato's birth and Columbus sailing across the Atlantic to find the new world, you would say, well look, it took 428 years to go from Plato's birth to this theoretical birth of Christ. And then you have another 1,492 years to wait until Columbus gets his ship together. So the total number of years would be, I'll do it right over here, 428 years to get to Christ from Plato's birth, and then you have another 1,492 years to wait for Columbus. So let's see, 8 plus 2, that is 10. As you can see, I just wanted to add a little arithmetic in this video. So 1 plus 2 plus 9 is 12. And then we have 9, 1 plus 4 plus 4. So 1,920 years between Plato's birth and Columbus sailing across the Atlantic."
7d26747f-f79d-4af1-95fb-37e65437713d,"Every rose has its thorn. Only the good die young, slow and steady wins the race. And what you see is what you get. Except that in reality, several varieties of roses do not have thorns. Both the good and the bad on occasion tragically die young. Fast and steady beats slow and steady every time. And what you see is... well... Our perception, or how we order the cacophonous chaos of our environment, is heavily influenced, biased even, by our expectations, experiences, moods, and even cultural norms. And we can be pretty good at fooling ourselves. In the last two lessons, we've learned how we see shapes and colors, hear sounds and smell, and taste the world's chemical concoctions. But our senses mean little without our brains' ability to organize and translate that data into meaningful perceptions. Without perception, your mother's face is just a combination of shapes. Without the ability to interpret scent, we couldn't differentiate the smell of toast from a grease fire. Our perception is the process that allows us to make meaning out of our senses and experience the world around us. It's what makes life understandable. But also, it means that sometimes, what you see is not actually what you get. So that was awesome, right? Upside down, I look like me. Right side up, I look like some kind of terrifying monster. Your brain isn't used to upside down faces, so it's basically just doing its best to put the pieces together. But it knows exactly what a right side up face should look like, and that is not it. Just one of thousands of examples proving that your brain does all the work of perception, and your eyes really are just feeding raw data. It's important data, but it isn't actually what we see. What we see is the realm of the mind, not the eye. What kind of bird do you see right now? A duck, right? But if I said, what kind of mammal do you see, a bunny probably would have popped out at you. Now, you should be seeing both of them, popping back and forth. But likely, your brain wants to perceive the image related to whichever cue you first heard, or whichever image is more familiar to you. By cueing mammal or bird, I influenced your expectations, and you saw what I wanted you to see. Pretty cool! Your expectations are just one factor in your perceptual set, the psychological factors that determine how you perceive your environment. Sometimes, seeing is believing, but perceptual set theory teaches us that believing is also seeing. Context is another factor in your perceptual set. If the duck-bunny thing was pictured with Easter eggs all around it, you'd think bunny right away, which is kind of weird, considering that of ducks and bunnies, one is actually much more likely to be near an egg. It's not the bunny. And that's an example of how culture is also an important part of our perceptual set. As much as our perceptions are affected by context and expectations, they're also swayed by our emotions and motivations. People will say a hill is more steep if they're listening to emo by themselves than if they're listening to power pop and walking with a friend. Most of the time, your personal perceptual set leads you to reasonable conclusions, but sets can also be misleading or even harmful. They're the basis of tons of entertaining optical illusions. These two tables, for example, are the same size, but the positions of their legs make that impossible for you to believe until I lay them over each other. And while all the fooling of our visual perception can be fun, it also helps us understand how it works. Our minds are given a tremendous amount of information, especially through the eyes, and we need to make quick work of it. Turning marks on a paper into words, blobby lumps into the face of a friend, seeing depth, color, movement, and contrast, being able to pick out an object from all the other clutter around it seems so simple. But we've come to discover that it is quite complicated, so complicated that we have a name for it, form perception. Take a neat little dynamic called the figure-ground relationship. It's how we organize and simplify whatever scene we're looking at into the main objects, or figures, and the surroundings, or ground, that they stand out against. The classic faces-or-vases illusion is an example. Is it two faces against a white background, or a vase against a black background? If you look long enough, you'll see that the relationship between the object and its surroundings flip back and forth, continually reversing. Sometimes white is the figure, and black is the ground. That figure-ground dynamic, though, is always there. The concept applies to non-visual fields as well. Say you're at a party, holding up the wall, and creeping on your crush across the room, trying to casually listen in on what they're saying. As the focus of your attention, that voice becomes the figure, while all the other voices jabbering about sports, and beer pong, and Sherlock, and everything that doesn't have to do with that one beautiful person, all becomes the ground. Now that your mind has distinguished figure from ground, it has to perceive that form as something meaningful. Like, for one, that large shape on the couch is a person. And further, that person isn't just any person, but the specific, unique person of your dreams. One way our minds shuffle all of these stimuli into something coherent is by following rules of grouping, like organizing things by proximity, continuity, or closure. The rule of proximity, for instance, simply states that we like to group nearby figures together. So instead of seeing a random garble of party-goers, we tend to mentally connect people standing next to each other, like there's the hockey team over there, and the debate team over there, and then you've got the band geeks. Why are all these people at the same party? We're also drawn to organize our world with attention to continuity, perceiving smooth, continuous patterns, and often ignoring broken ones. We also like closure, and not just after a breakup. Visually, we want to fill in gaps, to create whole objects. So here, we see an illusory triangle breaking the completion of these circles on the left, but just add the little lines, close up the circles, and you stop seeing the triangle. Horn perception is obviously crucial to making sense of the world, or, you know, a moderately interesting party. But imagine trying to navigate the world without depth perception. As you gaze upon your one true love, the image hits your retina in two dimensions, yet somehow you're still able to see the full three-dimensional gloriousness of their form. You can thank your depth perception for that. Depth perception is what helps us estimate an object's distance and full shape, in this case, a nice shape that is currently too far away from you. It is at least partially innate, even most babies have it. We're able to perceive depth by using both binocular and monocular visual cues. Binocular cues, as the name gives away, require the use of both eyes. Because your eyes are about 2.5 inches apart, your retinas receive ever-so-slightly different images. You know, camera one, camera two. So when you're looking with both your eyes, your brain compares the two images to help judge distance. The closer the object, the greater the difference between the two images, also known as the retinal disparity. Retinal disparity is pretty easy to see. You just hold your fingers up and then you look past them, and suddenly you have four instead of two fingers. Because those left and right images vary only slightly, retinal disparity doesn't help much when it comes to judging far-off distances. For that, we look to monocular cues to help us determine the scale and distance of an object. These are things like relative size and height, linear perspective, texture gradient, and interposition. Relative size allows you to determine that your crush is not supporting a tiny newborn chihuahua on their shoulder, but rather there's a full-grown chihuahua behind them in the back of the room. In the absence of a chihuahua or like object, you can also judge distances using your linear perspective. If you've ever made a perspective drawing in art class, you'll remember that parallel lines appear to meet as they move into the distance, just like the tiled floor. The sharper the angle of convergence and the closer the lines together, the greater the distance will seem. And if you've ever looked out at a mountain range or a Bob Ross painting, you'll understand texture gradient as the cue that makes the first ridge appear all rocky and textured, but as your eye follows the ridges into the distance, they become less detailed. And finally, our interposition or overlap cue tells us when one object, like this oaf here, blocks our view of something else, your crush, we perceive it as being closer. And in this case, especially annoying. So all these perceptual concepts can be demonstrated with a fixed image, but of course, life involves a lot of movement, at least if you're doing it right. We use motion perception to infer speed and direction of a moving object, like, your brain gauges motion based partly on the idea that shrinking objects are retreating and enlarging objects are approaching. The thing is, your brain is easily tricked when it comes to motion. For instance, large objects appear to move much more slowly than small ones going the same speed. And in addition to organizing things by form, depth, and motion, our perception of the world also requires consistency, or as psychologists call it, constancy. Perceptual constancy is what allows us to continue to recognize an object, regardless of its distance, viewing angle, motion, or illumination, even as it might appear to change color, size, shape, and brightness depending on the conditions. Like, we know what a chihuahua looks like, whether it looks like this, this, this, or this. In the end though, your perception isn't just about funky optical illusions, it's about how you understand the world and your place in it, both physically and psychologically. Your sensory organs pull in the world's raw data, which is disassembled into little bits of information, and then reassembled in your brain to form your own model of the world. It's like your senses are just collecting a bunch of Legos, and your brain can build and rebuild whatever it perceives. A party, your crush, a duck, or a chihuahua. In other words, your brain constructs your perceptions. And if you were correctly constructing your perceptions this lesson, you learned what forms your perceptual set, how form perception works, and the many visual cues that influence your depth perception.

bbfa3b77-9a3b-4ea1-81c3-bba139e576a4,"We left off in the last video in the Archean Eon, and where arche comes from, ancient Greek, it means beginning or origin. And it's the eon in which either life first started to exist, or at least it first started to somewhat flourish. It's possible that maybe life first started to exist at the end of the Hadean Eon. And of course, this boundary is vague. And the Archean Eon is also the first eon where we still have rocks from that time. So we are able to find rocks that we can date to be roughly 3.8 billion years. Now, the other really interesting thing that happened in the Archean Eon, it really has pretty profound effects once we get into the Proterozoic Eon, is that you started to have cyanobacteria produce oxygen. And we said in the last video that they were producing oxygen, but most of that oxygen was being absorbed by iron in the oceans. But what happens as we enter into the Proterozoic Eon, in Proterozoic Eon, this right over here, I don't know if you can see that, I'll rewrite it. Proterozoic. We're now in the Proterozoic Eon that starts up about 2.5 billion years ago. And Proterozoic comes from the Greek for earlier life. And I'm not a Greek scholar, so any of you Greeks out there, forgive me if I'm not getting the translation exactly right. But what's really interesting about the Proterozoic Eon is that that oxygen that was being produced by the cyanobacteria at some point begins to saturate the iron and any other molecule that could have absorbed it before. And once it saturates, it starts to get released into the atmosphere. So the oxygen starts to get released and accumulate in the atmosphere. And we think this started to happen about 2.4 billion years ago. So 2.4 billion years ago, oxygen begins to accumulate in the atmosphere. And of course, these dates, they might be moved around a few hundred million years if you get more and more data. But this is the current understanding of when things happen. And maybe we'll look at the geological record or the fossil record and we'll move these things around in the future. I could only imagine that 50 years from now or 100 years from now, if someone's still watching this video, a lot of this might say, hey, we found out later that oxygen started to accumulate in the atmosphere earlier or later or that eukaryotes occurred earlier or later. But this, as far as I can tell, is our best current understanding. But 2.4 billion years ago, oxygen begins to accumulate in the atmosphere. And what's interesting about this is once it accumulates and once it accumulates, it's kind of a critical amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. And I touched on this in the last video. About 2.3 billion years ago, we have something called the Great Oxygenation Event, sometimes called the Oxygen Catastrophe. And this is right here. They mark it on this right here, 2.3 billion years ago or 2,300 million years ago. Atmosphere becomes oxygen rich. And it's not as oxygen rich as our current atmosphere, but it becomes oxygen rich enough that at least the environment becomes suitable for eukaryotic organisms or eukaryotic cells. Now, the other interesting thing, and we might not care so much about it because we needed the oxygen, is that we think that this was actually the greatest extinction event in the history of Earth. That's why it's called the Oxygen Catastrophe. So this right over here, 2.3 billion years ago, I shouldn't giggle about it. This is a serious matter. This is the greatest extinction event in Earth's history. And I'll do history with a capital H. In Earth's history of the Earth. And that's because the cyanobacteria is producing all this oxygen, eventually saturates the iron. It accumulates in the air. Once it gets to enough concentration, it begins to actually suffocate. It's poisonous. It's poisonous to most of the other organisms on the planet that were anaerobic, that did not need oxygen, that actually found oxygen poisonous. Now, but since we have oxygen, there's two interesting things that happened once that oxygen accumulated, other than causing this mass extinction event. Actually, three interesting things. Two of them are crucial to us eventually showing up on this planet. The first is that it became suitable now for eukaryotes to exist. Eukaryotic organisms, remember, these are organisms that have nuclear membranes around their DNA. Most eukaryotes have other organelles, like mitochondria. They need oxygen. You can go to the biology playlist. We actually talk about respiration that occurs in the mitochondria. And that's obviously a process that needs oxygen. So one, now that oxygen is in the atmosphere, we're starting to have an environment where eukaryotes could at least exist. And based on the fossil records, and when we look at how the DNA has changed over time, and we'll do multiple videos of that, we think that the first eukaryotes showed up about 2.2 billion years ago. Although there's some debate here. There's some evidence it might have been a little earlier, some evidence it might have been a little later. I'm sure that number will be refined. But about, give or take a few hundred millions of years, one prokaryote got engulfed by another prokaryote and said, hey, we do pretty well living together. The current theory is that mitochondria is actually descended from a kind of an ancient prokaryotic cell, an ancient bacteria. It actually has its own DNA. And actually, your mitochondrial DNA is passed down from your mother, and your mother's mother, and your mother's mother, so on and so forth. So it's kind of like another little animal living inside of a larger cell. And we are eukaryotes. We needed this to happen. The human body, we're not just one eukaryotic cell. We're made up of trillions. Estimates are 50 to 100 trillion eukaryotic cells. So this was a super, these are our ancestors that had to come into being at that time. And once again, all of this is happening inside of the oceans. Now the other interesting thing that happened. Remember, we're being bombarded with UV radiation from the sun. So if you're on the land, let me draw the land and the ocean. So here is the ocean, and then here is the land, right over there in yellow, constantly being bombarded with UV radiation. And UV stands for ultraviolet, so I'm drawing it in purple. But it's even more violet than purple. So it's constantly being bombarded with ultraviolet radiation from the sun, which is very inhospitable to DNA and to life. And so the only life at this point could occur in the ocean, where it was protected to some degree from the ultraviolet radiation. The land was just open to it. Anything on the land would have just gotten irradiated. Its DNA would get mutated. It just would not be able to live. So what happened, and what I guess has to happen, and the reason why we are able to live on land now is that we have an ozone layer. We have an ozone layer up in the upper atmosphere that helps absorb, that blocks most of the UV radiation from the sun. And now that oxygen began to accumulate, we have the oxygen catastrophe. Oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere. Some of that oxygen goes into the upper atmosphere. So we're now in this time period right over here. It goes into the upper atmosphere. It actually reacts with the UV light to turn into ozone, which then can help actually block the UV light. And I'll do another video maybe on the ozone oxygen cycle. So this oxygen production, it's crucial, one, to having an ozone layer so that eventually life can exist on the land. And it's also crucial because eukaryotic organisms need that oxygen. Now the third thing that happened, this is also a pretty significant event, we believe that that oxygen that started to accumulate in the atmosphere reacted with methane in the atmosphere. So it reacted with methane. And methane is a greenhouse gas. It helps retain heat in the atmosphere. And once it reacts with the oxygen and starts dropping out of the atmosphere as methane, we believe the Earth cooled down. And it entered its first, and some people believe, its longest snowball period. So that's what they talk about right here on this diagram. The first snowball Earth. It's sometimes called the Huronic glaciation. And that happened because we weren't able to retain our heat, if that theory is correct. And so as the theory goes, the whole Earth essentially just iced over. So as we go through the Proterozoic eon, I guess the big markers of it is it's the first time that we now have an oxygen-rich atmosphere. It's the first time that eukaryotes can now come into existence. Because they now have oxygen to, I guess we could say, breathe. And the other big thing is now this is where the ozone forms. So this kind of sets the stage in the next eon for animals or living things to eventually get onto the land. And we'll talk about that in the next video."
c6e2432d-4e05-4ca6-823e-2b0f2c9f25b9,"Let me tell you about Oliver Sacks, the famous physician, professor, and author of unusual neurological case studies. We'll be looking at some of his fascinating research in future lessons, but for now, I just want to talk about Sacks himself. Although he possesses a brilliant and inquisitive mind, Dr. Sacks cannot do a simple thing that your average toddler can. He can't recognize his own face in the mirror. Sacks has a form of prosopagnosia, a neurological disorder that impairs a person's ability to perceive or recognize faces, also known as face blindness. Last week, we talked about how brain function is localized, and this is another peculiarly excellent example of that. Sacks can recognize his coffee cup on the shelf, but he can't pick out his oldest friend from a crowd, because the specific sliver of his brain responsible for facial recognition is malfunctioning. There's nothing wrong with his vision. The sense is intact. The problem is with his perception, at least when it comes to recognizing faces. Prosopagnosia is a good example of how sensing and perceiving are connected, but different. Sensation is the bottom-up process by which our senses, like vision, hearing, and smell, receive and relay outside stimuli. Perception, on the other hand, is the top-down way that our brains organize and interpret that information and put it into context. So right now, at this very moment, you're probably receiving light from your screen through your eyes, which will send the data of that sensation to your brain. Perception, meanwhile, is your brain telling you that what you're seeing is a diagram explaining the difference between sensation and perception, which is pretty meta. Now, your brain is interpreting that light as a talking person, whom your brain might additionally recognize as Hank. 🎵Hank's Theme Song🎵 We are constantly bombarded by stimuli, even though we're only aware of what our own senses can pick up. Like, I can see, and hear, and feel, and even smell this corgi. But I can't hunt using sonar like a bat, or hear a mole tunneling underground like an owl, or see ultraviolet and infrared light like a mantis shrimp. I probably can't even smell half of what you can smell. No. No. We have different senses. Mmmmmmm. Yeah. There's a lot to sense in the world, and not everybody needs to sense all the same stuff. So every animal has its limitations, which we can talk about more precisely if we define the absolute threshold of sensation, the minimum stimulation needed to register a particular stimulus 50% of the time. So if I play a tiny little beep in your ear, and you tell me that you hear it 50% of the times that I play it, that's your absolute threshold of sensation. We have to use a percentage, because sometimes I'll play the beep and you'll hear it, and sometimes you won't, even though it's the exact same volume. Why? Because brains are complicated. Detecting a weak sensory signal, like that beep in daily life, isn't only about the strength of the stimulus. It's also about your psychological state, your alertness and expectations in the moment. This has to do with signal detection theory, a model for predicting how and when a person will detect a weak stimuli, partly based on context. Exhausted new parents might hear their baby's tiniest whimper, but not even register the bellow of a passing train. Their paranoid parent brains are so trained on their baby, it gives their senses a sort of boosted ability, but only in relation to the subject of their attention. Conversely, if you're experiencing constant stimulation, your senses will adjust, in a process called sensory adaptation. It's the reason that I have to check and see if my wallet is there if it's in my right pocket, but if I move it to my left pocket, it feels like a big, uncomfortable lump. It's also useful to be able to talk about our ability to detect the difference between two stimuli. I might go out at night and look up at the sky, and well, I know, with my objective science brain, that no two stars have the exact same brightness. And yeah, I can tell with my eyeballs that some stars are brighter than others, but other stars, they just look exactly the same to me. I can't tell the difference in their brightness. Are you, are you done? Is it time for you to go? Gimme, gimme your car! Yes, yes. Okay. Good girl. The point at which one can tell the difference is the different threshold, but it's not linear. Like, if a tiny star is just a tiny bit brighter than another tiny star, I can tell. But if a big star is that same tiny amount brighter than another big star, I won't be able to tell the difference. This is important enough that we gave the guy who discovered it a law. Weber's law says that we perceive differences on a logarithmic, not linear scale. It's not the amount of change, it's the percentage change that matters. Alright, how about now we take a more in-depth look at how one of our most powerful senses works? Vision. Your ability to see your face in the mirror is the result of a long, but lightning-quick sequence of events. Light bounces off your face, and then off the mirror, and then into your eyes, which take in all that varied energy and transforms it into neural messages that your brain processes and organizes into what you actually see, which is your face. Or if you're looking elsewhere, maybe you see a coffee cup, or a corgi, or a scary clown holding a tiny cream pie. So how do we transform light waves into meaningful information? Well, let's start with the light itself. What we humans see as light is only a small fraction of the full spectrum of electromagnetic radiation that ranges from gamma to radio waves. Now, light has all kinds of fascinating characteristics that determine how we sense it. But, for the purposes of this topic, we'll understand light as traveling in waves. The wave's wavelength and frequency determines their hue, and their amplitude determines their intensity, or brightness. For instance, a short wave has a high frequency. Our eyes register short wavelengths with high frequencies as bluish colors, while we see long, low-frequency wavelengths as reddish hues. The way we register the brightness of a color, the contrast between the orange of a sherbert and the orange of a construction cone, has to do with the intensity, or amount of energy, in a given light wave, which, as we just said, is determined by its amplitude. Greater amplitude means higher intensity, means brighter color. Someone just told me that sherbert doesn't, isn't a word that exists. His name is Michael Aranda and he's a dumbhead. Did you type it into the dictionary? Type it into Google. Ask Google about sherbert. So sherbert is a thing. So after taking in this light through the cornea and the pupil, it hits the transparent disc behind the pupil, the lens, which focuses the light rays into specific images. And just as you'd expect a lens to do, it projects these images onto the retina, the inner surface of the eyeball that contains all the receptor cells that begin sensing that visual information. Now, your retinas don't receive a full image like a movie being projected onto a screen. It's more like a bunch of pixel points of light energy that millions of receptors translate into neural impulses and zip back into the brain. These retinal receptors are called rods and cones. Our rods detect grayscale and are used in our peripheral vision, as well as to avoid stubbing our toes in twilight conditions when we can't really see in color. Our cones detect fine detail and color. Concentrated near the retina's central focal point, called the fovea, cones function only in well-lit conditions, allowing you to appreciate the intricacies of your grandma's china pattern or your uncle's sleeve tattoo. And the human eye is terrific at seeing color. Our difference threshold for colors is so exceptional that the average person can distinguish a million different hues. There's a good deal of ongoing research around exactly how our color vision works, but two theories help explain some of what we know. One model, called the Young-Hemholtz trichromatic theory, suggests that the retina houses three specific color receptor cones that register red, green, and blue, and when stimulated together, their combined power allows the eye to register any color. Unless, of course, you're colorblind. About one in fifty people have some level of color vision deficiency. They're mostly dudes, because the genetic defect is sex-linked. If you can't see the Crash Course logo pop out at you in this figure, it's likely that your red or green cones are missing or malfunctioning, which means that you have dichromatic instead of trichromatic vision, and can't distinguish between shades of red and green. The other model for color vision, known as the Opponent Process Theory, suggests that we see color through processes that actually work against each other. So some receptor cells might be stimulated by red, but inhibited by green, while others do the opposite, and those combinations allow us to register colors. But back to your eyeballs. When stimulated, the rods and cones trigger chemical changes that spark neural signals, which in turn activate the cells behind them, called bipolar cells, whose job it is to turn on the neighboring ganglion cells. The long axon tails of these ganglions braid together to form the ropey optic nerve, which is what carries the neural impulses from the eyeball to the brain. That visual information then slips through a chain of progressively complex levels, as it travels from optic nerve to the thalamus, and on to the brain's visual cortex. The visual cortex sits at the back of the brain in the occipital lobe, where the right cortex processes input from the left eye, and vice versa. This cortex has specialized nerve cells, called feature detectors, that respond to specific features like shapes, angles, and movements. In other words, different parts of your visual cortex are responsible for identifying different aspects of things. A person who can't recognize human faces may have no trouble picking out their set of keys from a pile on the counter. That's because the brain's object perception occurs in a different place from its face perception. In the case of Dr. Sachs, his condition affects the region of the brain called the fusiform gyrus, which activates in response to seeing faces. Sachs's face blindness is congenital, but it may also be acquired through disease or injury to that same region of the brain. And some cells in a region may respond to just one type of stimulus, like posture or movement or facial expression, while other clusters of cells weave all that separate information together in an instant analysis of a situation. That clown is frowning and running at me with a tiny cream pie. I'm putting these factors together. Maybe I should get out of here. This ability to process and analyze many separate aspects of the situation at once is called parallel processing. In the case of visual processing, this means that the brain simultaneously works on making sense of form, depth, motion, and color. And this is where we enter the whole world of perception, which gets complicated quickly, and can even get downright philosophical. So we'll be exploring that in depth next time, but for now, if you were paying attention, you learned the difference between sensation and perception, the different thresholds that limit our senses, and some of the neurology and biology and psychology of human vision.

856b5ae2-edfb-4645-98a1-f790b2770ea8,"In the early 1800s, German physician Franz Joseph Gall spent a lot of time running his fingers over the scalps of strangers. He wasn't a hairdresser. He wasn't a masseuse. He wasn't, like, just a big fan of heads. He was a phrenologist. He was the first phrenologist. Gall believed that a person's personality was linked to their skull morphology, that its bumps and ridges indicated aspects of their character. Amazingly, this science actually caught on, was widely practiced for decades, and Gall became something of a celebrity. Well, with a head like his, one can see how he might have been a little bit fixated with skull shape. Eventually, phrenology was dismissed as a cult pseudoscience, because it turns out that your cranial contours tell us exactly nothing about what's happening inside the brain. And yet, Gall was actually onto something big, something that we knew nothing about. Remember, at this point, we were just starting to get consensus that the brain was the source of self, and not, like, the soul, or the heart, or whatever. His lasting and correct proposition was that different parts of the brain control specific aspects of our behavior. Like we talked about last time, there's a strong link between biological activity and psychological events. But in addition to the interplay of chemicals, like neurotransmitters and hormones, a lot of this also has to do with the fact that localized parts of the brain have specific functions, like vision, movement, memory, speech, even facial recognition. Function, in other words, is localized. If you could stimulate different parts of my brain any way you wanted to, and if you asked me nicely, I just might let you, you could control my movements, my memories, even my personality. Poke my brain over here, and my arm would twitch. Poke it here, and I'd remember my first kiss. Do it up here, and suddenly I'd be filled with a tremendous hulk-like rage! This is about the link between the brain, that physical hunk of gunk between the ears, and the mind, the thing that is us, our consciousness, our behavior, our decisions, our memories, ourselves. Some neuroscientists like to say that the mind is what the brain does. So one of the driving questions of psychology, and, like, the human experiment, is how do our brain's functions tie to the behavior of the mind? And you can't even ask the right questions, let alone get at some of the answers, until you get to know the brain. [♪ INTRO MUSIC ♪ You might have a passing familiarity with your nervous system, like the brain bones connected to the spinal cord bone, and the spinal cord bones connected to the motor neuron bone. That's your central nervous system, and there aren't actually any bones. The central nervous system, or just CNS, is what makes your body's big decisions. This system is the command center, and if you mess with it, things are gonna get weird. There's also the peripheral nervous system, which is composed of scout-like sensory neurons that gather information and report it back to the central nervous system. But to get a handle on just how physical the roots of your mind and personality are, how concretely your nervous system makes you you, let me tell you a story. The Curious Case of Phineas Gage. In 1848, a genial chap named Phineas Gage was working on the railroad, tamping gunpowder into a blasting hole with an iron rod, when the gunpowder ignited. The resulting explosion caused the rod to shoot like a bullet up through his left cheek and out the top of his head. There's brain in between those two places, by the way. Interestingly, he stood up after the accident, walked over to a cart, described what had happened, and then they drove him back to his house, all while he was conscious. So the doctor came to examine him, and refused to believe that a rod had in fact passed through his head, understandably, until Phineas started coughing and an amount of brain that the doctor described as a teacup full fell out of his head, and the doctor had to accept, indeed, what had happened. After a few months of convalescing, he was pretty much healed up and moving around like he used to. But some of his friends were saying that Phineas was no longer himself. Yes, he had his memories and mental abilities, and he walked and talked and looked the same minus an eyeball. But whereas the old Phineas was mild-mannered and soft-spoken, the post-spiked-to-the-brain Phineas was surly and mean-spirited and vulgar. People started to describe him as no longer Gage. Phineas moved away from America, the scientific establishment lost contact with him, and twelve years later, after a series of seizures, he died at the age of 36. Phineas is a great, if extreme, example of how function is localized in the brain, and how physical biological factors can be reflected in psychological ways. Of course, he's also an excellent example of how individual case studies are not particularly useful, especially since we have very little data on what Phineas was actually like before, or even after, his accident. Most accounts are from the months directly after the accident, and many of them conflict. It's completely possible that he continued to heal and lived his remaining years as a happy and productive citizen. Inter-psychology texts often paint a pretty simple picture of Phineas, just so that we can have a clear example of the moment when physicians realized that messing with the brain was messing with the mind. But it is, of course, all much more complicated, and as Phineas was an actual, real-life person, I feel like we should give him the nuance and mystery that he deserves. Now, you might have heard that we only use about 10% of our brains, and oh, if that were true, Phineas could lose a quarter of his, and he'd be just fine. And if we could just harness the rest of that gray mush, we'd be able to mind-read and levitate and get all Professor X. It's an exciting thought, as exciting as the idea that I can tell what kind of tea you like by feeling the bumps on your head. It is also exactly as wrong. After watching an hour or so of reality TV, you'd be forgiven for thinking that some people are only working at 10% brain capacity. But in actual reality, brain scans show that nearly every region of the brain lights up during even simple tasks, like walking and talking. Not only that, but the brain itself requires 20% of all the body's energy, and it would make little evolutionary sense to throw much energy away at something that's only minimally active. As animals, our capabilities have developed in part from our brain structures. We're actually able to trace our evolutionary history as we come to understand these structures. Less complex animals have simpler brains, designed for basic functioning and survival – rest, breathe, eat. Whereas more complex animals, like many mammals, possess brains that feel, remember, reason, and predict. These animals don't have all-new systems. They have new brain systems built upon old brain systems. The brain is kind of like a set of Russian nesting dolls. The outermost wooden doll is the newest, most detailed, and most complex. But as you go deeper, the dolls become older, and smaller, and simpler, and more generic. The innermost wooden doll is the oldest, most basic. It's like a fossil in your head. This inner core of the brain, sometimes called the old brain, still performs for us much as it did for our early evolutionary ancestors. It's anchored by the brainstem, the most ancient and central core of the brain, where the spinal cord enters the skull. Above it, at the base of the skull, is the medulla. Here, old brain functions happen automatically, without any conscious effort – the beating of hearts, the breathing of lungs, that sort of thing. The pons is perched on the medulla, and it helps coordinate movement. Above the pons, at the top of the brainstem, is the thalamus, a pair of egg-shaped structures that take in sensory information related to seeing, hearing, touching, and tasting. The reticular formation is a finger-shaped nerve network inside the brainstem that's essential for arousal, which isn't necessarily what you feel upon seeing a particularly nice looking human, but instead refers to things like sleeping and walking, and pain perception, other important functions. The baseball-sized cerebellum, or little brain, swells from the bottom of the brainstem, and is responsible for nonverbal learning and memory, the perception of time, and modulating emotions. It controls voluntary movement, like your sweet dance moves, but it also gets impaired easily under the influence of alcohol, hence the term tipsy. So the old brain systems keep our body's basic functions running smoothly, the sort of stuff any animal might need. This is pretty much where the brain stops, for reptiles. For higher functions, we look to the limbic system. This includes the amygdala, hypothalamus, and hippocampus. Sort of a border region of the brain, separating the old brain and the newer, higher cerebral areas. The amygdala consists of two lima bean-sized clusters of neurons, and is responsible for memory consolidation, as well as both our greatest fear and hottest aggression. Stimulate one area of the amygdala, and a docile family dog suddenly morts into a bloodthirsty Cujo. If you throw an electrode over just a tiny bit, that dog will be cowering at butterfly shadow puppets. The hypothalamus keeps your whole body steady, regulating body temperature, circadian rhythms, and hunger. Also helps govern the endocrine system, especially the pituitary gland. You should also thank your hypothalamus for allowing you to feel pleasure and reward. Rats implanted with electrodes in the reward center of their hypothalamuses, and given ways to self-stimulate those areas, will essentially reward themselves until they collapse, or die. So, use with caution. The final part of the limbic system is the hippocampus, central to learning and memory, and if it's damaged, a person may lose their ability to retain new facts and memories. Now, above all of this is the most advanced stuff, the stuff that you think of when you think of the brain, the gray matter. The two hemispheres of your cerebrum make up about 85% of your brain weight, and oversee your ability to think, speak, and perceive. The left and right hemispheres govern and regulate differing functions, giving us a split brain, connected by a structure called the corpus callosum. So for instance, language production is controlled largely by the left hemisphere, while certain creative functions are controlled by the right. Though this has nothing to do with handedness, or people having dominant sides of their brain being more analytical or creative or whatever, that's part of what we call pop psychology, a behavioral disorder in which journalists and armchair psychologists use research showing beautiful, detailed, intimately connected complexities of your brain to sell newspapers or reinforce previously held beliefs. Yes, some tasks are distributed to one side, but the sides are deeply and constantly connected. A statement as general as artistic people use their right brains is as useless as saying artistic people have particularly bumpy heads. Finally, covering the left and right hemispheres, we have the cerebral cortex, a thin layer of over 20 billion interconnected neurons. But let's not forget the unsung heroes of your nervous system, the billions of non-neuron glial cells, which provide a spiderweb of support that surround, insulate, and nourish these cerebral neurons. You've probably seen enough brain diagrams to know that the cerebral cortex's left and right sides are subdivided into four lobes, the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal, all separated by especially prominent folds, or fissures. Each lobe does indeed have its own set of duties that would have made Franz Gall proud. The frontal lobes, just behind your forehead, are involved in speaking, planning, judging, abstract thinking, and as the tale of Phineas Gage reminds us, aspects of personality. The parietal lobes receive and process your sense of touch and body position. At the back of your head, the occipital lobes receive information related to sight. And the temporal lobes, just above your ears, process sound, including speech comprehension. Remember that each hemisphere controls the opposite side of the body, so my left temporal lobe processes sounds heard through my right ear. And within these lobes, there are still more regions that have specialized functions. Your motor cortex, at the rear of your frontal lobes, for example, controls voluntary movements and sends messages from the brain out to the body, like, pet that dog, or pick up that mug. While your sensory cortex, right behind it, processes incoming sensations, like, ooh, that doggie is soft, or gah, that mug is hot! The rest of your gray matter is made up of association areas that are related to higher mental functions, like remembering, thinking, learning, and speaking. But the thing about association areas is that, unlike your sensory or motor cortex, you couldn't just poke one and create a neat response. Association areas are more subtle. They deal with things like interpreting and integrating sensory input and linking it up with memories. And they prevail throughout all four lobes, so brain damage to different areas will cause very different results. A lesion on a specific part of the temporal lobe may destroy a person's ability to recognize faces. Traumatic memories or overactive hormones can profoundly affect our behavior and emotions, all of which remind us how, fundamentally, biology and psychology are intertwined. And there are a few more fascinating examples of this than how we sense and perceive the world around us, so that's where we're going to pick up next week. But for now, if you were paying attention, you learned the basics of the central nervous system, specifically the brain, which can be understood in terms of old or more evolutionarily ancestral structures, along with the limbic system and new structures, which include lobes, cortices, and association areas.

28de6a27-73a0-4f06-b146-01c431a11b68,"What I want to do in this video is kind of introduce you to the idea of, one, how carbon-14 comes about and how it gets into all living things, and then either later in this video or in future videos, we'll talk about how it's actually used to date things, how we use it to actually figure out that that bone is 12,000 years old, that that person died 18,000 years ago, whatever it might be. So let me draw the Earth. So let me just draw the surface of the Earth like that. It's just a little section of the surface of the Earth, and then we have the atmosphere of the Earth. I'll draw that in yellow. So then you have the Earth's atmosphere right over here. Let me write that down. Atmosphere. Atmosphere. And 78%, the most abundant element in our atmosphere is nitrogen. It is 78% nitrogen, and I'll write nitrogen. Its symbol is just N, and it has 7 protons, and it also has 7 neutrons. So it has an atomic mass of roughly 14, and this is the most typical isotope of nitrogen, and we talk about the word isotope in the chemistry playlist. An isotope, the protons define what element it is, but this number up here can change depending on the number of neutrons you have. So the different versions of a given element, those are each called isotopes. I just view them in my head as versions of an element. So anyway, we have our atmosphere, and then coming from our sun, we have what's commonly called cosmic rays, but they're actually not rays. They're cosmic particles. They're mainly, you can view them as just single protons, which is the same thing as a hydrogen nucleus. They can also be alpha particles, which is the same thing as a helium nucleus, and there's even a few electrons. They're going to come in, and they're going to bump into things in our atmosphere, and they're actually going to form neutrons. So they're actually going to form neutrons, and we'll show a neutron with a lowercase n and a 1 for its mass number, and we don't write anything because it has no protons down here. Like we had for nitrogen, we had 7 protons, so it's not really an element. It is a subatomic particle, but you have these neutrons form, and every now and then, and let's just be clear, this isn't like a typical reaction, but every now and then, one of those neutrons will bump into one of the nitrogen-14s in just the right way, so that it bumps off one of the protons in the nitrogen, and essentially replaces that proton with itself. So let me make it clear. So it bumps off one of the protons, so instead of 7 protons, we now have 6 protons, but this number 14 doesn't go down to 13 because it replaces it with itself, so this still stays at 14, and now since it only has 6 protons, this is no longer nitrogen. By definition, this is now carbon, and that proton that was bumped off just kind of gets emitted. So then, let me just do that in another color. So plus, and a proton that's just flying around, you could call that hydrogen-1, and it can gain an electron in some ways. If it doesn't gain an electron, it's just a hydrogen ion, a positive ion, either way, or a hydrogen nucleus. But this process, and once again, it's not a typical process, but it happens every now and then, this is how carbon-14 forms. So this right here is carbon-14. You can essentially view it as a nitrogen-14 where one of the protons is replaced with a neutron. And what's interesting about this is this is constantly being formed in our atmosphere, not in huge quantities, but in reasonable quantities. So let me write this down. Constantly being formed. Constant formation. And what happens is, and let me be very clear. Let's look at the periodic table over here. Typical carbon, so carbon by definition, if you have 6 protons, carbon by definition, it has 6 protons. But the typical isotope, the most common isotope of carbon, is carbon-12. So carbon-12 is the most common. So most of the carbon in your body is carbon-12. But what's interesting is that a small fraction of carbon-14 forms, and then this carbon-14 can then also combine with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. And then that carbon dioxide gets absorbed into the rest of the atmosphere, into our oceans. It can be fixed by plants. When people talk about carbon fixation, they're really talking about using mainly light energy from the sun to take gaseous carbon and turn it into actual kind of organic tissue. And so this carbon-14 makes its way. It's constantly being formed. It makes its way into oceans. It's already in the air, but it completely mixes through the whole atmosphere. Oceans and the air. And then it makes its way into plants. And then it makes its way into plants. They're really just made out of that fixed carbon, that carbon that was taken in gaseous form and put into, I guess you could say, into kind of a solid form, put it into a living form. That's what wood pretty much is. It gets put into plants, and then it gets put into the things that eat the plants. So that could be us. Now why is this even interesting? I've just explained a mechanism where some of our body, even though carbon-12 is the most common isotope, some of our body, while we're living, gets made up of this carbon-14 thing. Well, the interesting thing is the only time you can take in this carbon-14 is while you're alive, while you're eating new things. Because as soon as you die and you get buried under the ground, there's no way for the carbon-14 to become part of your tissue anymore because you're not eating anything with new carbon-14. And what's interesting here is once you die, you're not going to get any new carbon-14, and that carbon-14 that you did have at your death is going to decay via beta decay, and we learned about this, back into nitrogen-14. So this process reverses. So it'll decay back into nitrogen-14 and beta decay. You emit an electron and an electron antineutrino. I won't go into the details of that. But essentially what you have happening here is you have one of the neutrons is turning into a proton and emitting this stuff in the process. Now why is this interesting? So I just said while you're living, you have kind of straight-up carbon-14, and carbon-14 is constantly doing this decay thing. But what's interesting is as soon as you die and you're not ingesting any more plants or breathing from the atmosphere, if you are a plant, or fixing from the atmosphere, and this even applies to plants, once the plant dies, it's no longer taking in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turning it into new tissue. The carbon-14 in that tissue gets frozen, and this carbon-14 does this decay at a specific rate. And then you can use that rate to actually determine how long ago that thing must have died. So the rate at which this happens, so the rate of carbon-14 decay, is essentially half disappears, half gone in roughly 5,730 years. And this is actually called a half-life. And we talk about it in other videos. This is called a half-life. And I want to be clear here. You don't know which half of it's gone. It's a probabilistic thing. You can't just say, oh, all of the carbon-14s on the left are going to decay and all the carbon-14s on the right aren't going to decay in that 5,730 years. What it's essentially saying is any given carbon-14 atom has a 50% chance of decaying into nitrogen-14 in 5,730 years. So over the course of 5,730 years, roughly half of them will have decayed. Now why is that interesting? Well, if you know that all living things have a certain proportion of carbon-14 in their tissue as kind of part of what makes them up, and then if you were to find some bone, let's just say find some bone right here. You dig it up on some type of archaeology dig. And you say, hey, that bone has one-half the carbon-14 of all the living things that you see right now. So you could, it would be a pretty reasonable estimate to say, well, that thing must be 5,730 years old. Even better, maybe you dig a little deeper and you find another bone. Maybe you find another bone, maybe a couple of feet even deeper. And you say, wow, you know, this thing right over here has one-fourth the carbon-14. This has one-fourth the carbon-14 that I would expect to find in something living. So how old is this? Well, if it only has one-fourth the carbon-14, it must have gone through two half-lives. After one half-life, it would have one-half the carbon. And then after another half-life, half of that also turns into nitrogen-14. And so this would involve two half-lives, which is the same thing as 2 times 5,730 years. Or you would say that this thing is what? This thing is 10,000, you'd say this thing is 11,460 years old, give or take."
