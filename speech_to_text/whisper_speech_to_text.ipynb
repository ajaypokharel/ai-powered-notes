       "    \"text\": \"As we begin our journey into the world of economics, I thought I would begin with a quote from one of the most famous economists of all times, the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith. And he really is kind of the first real economist in the way that we view it now. And this is from his The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, coincidentally, the same year as the American Declaration of Independence. And it's one of the most famous excerpts. He generally, indeed, he being an economic actor, neither intends to promote the public interest nor knows how much he is promoting it. By directing that industry, so the industry in control of that individual actor, in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain. He intends only his own gain. And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. And this term, invisible hand, is famous. Led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. He's saying, look, when individual actors just act in their own self-interest, that often an aggregate leads to things that each of those individual actors did not intend. And then he says, nor is it always the worst for society that it was no part of it. So it's not always necessarily a bad thing. By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. So this is a pretty strong statement. It's really at the core of capitalism. And that's why I point out that it was published the same year as the American Declaration of Independence because, obviously, America, the founding fathers, they wrote the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution. It really talks about what it means to be a democratic country. What are the rights of its citizens? But the United States, in its overall, the overall experience of an American is at least as influenced by the work of Adam Smith, by these kind of foundational ideas of capitalism. And they just both happened to happen around the same time. But this idea, it's not always that intuitive. Individual actors, by essentially pursuing their own self-interested ends, might be doing more for society than if any of them actually try to promote the overall well-being of society. And I don't think Adam Smith would say that it's always good for someone to act self-interested or that it's never good for people to actually think about the implications of what they're doing in an aggregate sense. But he's saying that frequently, frequently, this self-interested action could lead to the greater good, could lead to more innovation, could lead to better investment, could lead to more productivity, could lead to more wealth, more, a larger pie for everyone. And now economics is frequently, and when he makes a statement, he's actually making a mix of a microeconomic and a macroeconomic statement. Micro is that people, individual actors, are acting in their own self-interest. And the macro is that it might be good for the economy or for the nation as a whole. And so now, modern economists tend to divide themselves into these two schools or into these two subjects. Microeconomics, which is the study of individual actors. Microeconomics, and those actors could be firms, it could be people, it could be households. And you have macroeconomics, which is the study of the economy in aggregate. Macroeconomics. And you get it from their words. Micro, the prefix, refers to very small things. Macro refers to the larger, the bigger picture. And so microeconomics, just to restate it, is essentially how actors make decisions, or I guess we could say allocations, allocations, decisions slash allocations, allocations of scarce resources. And you're gonna hear the word scarce resources a lot when people talk about economics. And a scarce resource is one that you don't have an infinite amount of. For example, love might not be a scarce resource. You might have an infinite amount of love. But a resource that would be scarce is something like food or water or money or time or labor. These are all scarce resources. And so microeconomics is, well, how do people decide where to put those scarce resources? How do they decide where to deploy them? And how does that affect prices and markets and whatever else? Macroeconomics is a study of what happens in aggregate to an economy. So aggregate, what happens in aggregate to an economy from the millions of individual actors? Aggregate, aggregate economy. We now have millions, millions of actors. And it often focuses on policy-related questions. So do you raise or lower taxes? Or what's going to happen when you raise or lower taxes? Do you regulate or deregulate? How does that affect the overall productivity when you do these? So it's policy, top, top-down, top-down questions. And in both macro and microeconomics, especially in the modern sense of it, there's an attempt to make them rigorous, to make them mathematical. So in either case, you can start with some of the ideas, some of the philosophical ideas or the logical ideas that, say, someone like an Adam Smith might have. So you have these, and there are basic ideas about how people think, how people make decisions. So philosophy of people of decision-making, in the case of microeconomics, decision-making. And then you make some assumptions about it, or you simplify it. So I'll do the right, this. You simplify it. And you really are simplifying. You say, oh, all people are rational, or all people are gonna act in their own self-interest, or all people are going to maximize their gain, which isn't true. Human beings are motivated by a whole bunch of things. But you simplify these things so that you can start to deal with it in kind of a mathematical way. So you simplify it so you can start dealing with it in a mathematical sense. And this is valuable. It can clarify your thinking. It can allow you to prove things based on your assumptions. And you can start to visualize things mathematically with charts and graphs, and think about what will actually happen with the markets. So it's very, very valuable to have this mathematical rigorous thinking. But at the same time, it can be a little bit dangerous because you're making these huge simplifications. And sometimes the math might lead you to some very strong conclusions, conclusions which you might feel very strongly about because it looks like you've proven them the same way that you might prove relativity, but they were based on some assumptions that either might be wrong or might be oversimplifications or might not be relevant to the context that you're trying to make conclusions about. So it's very, very, very important to take it all with a grain of salt, to remember that it's all based on some simplifying assumptions. And macroeconomics is probably even more guilty of it. In microeconomics, you're taking these deeply complicated things, the human brain, how people act and respond to each other, and then you're aggregating it over millions of people. So it's ultra complicated. You have millions of these infinitely complicated people all interacting with each other. So it's very complicated. Many millions of interactions and fundamentally unpredictable interactions, and then trying to make assumptions on those, trying to make assumptions, and then doing math with that that could lead you to some conclusions or might lead you to some predictions. And once again, it's very important. This is valuable. It's valuable to make these mathematical models, to make these mathematical assumptions, these mathematical conclusions, but it always needs to be taken with a grain of salt. And so that you have a proper grain of salt and so that you are always focused on the true intuition, and that's really the most important thing to get from a course of economics so that you can truly reason through what's likely to happen, maybe even without the mathematics. I'll leave you with two quotes. And these quotes are a little bit, they're a little bit funny, but they really, I think, are helpful things to keep in mind as you start to especially go deep into the mathematical side of economics. So this right over here is a quote by Alfred Knopf, who was a publisher in the 1900s. An economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible. And I'm assuming when he's talking about the incomprehensible, he's referring to some of the mathy stuff that you see in economics. And hopefully we'll make this as comprehensible as possible and see that there is value in this. But it's a very important statement he's making. Oftentimes it's stating a common sense thing. It's stating something that's obvious. It's obvious, and it's very important to always keep that in mind, to always make sure that you have the intuition for what's happening in the math, or to know when the math is going in a direction that might be strange based on oversimplifications or wrong assumptions. And then you have this quote over here by Lawrence J. Peter, most famous for Peter's Principles, professor at USC. An economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn't happen today. And once again, important to keep in the back of one's mind because especially, and this is especially relevant to macroeconomics, because in macroeconomics, there's all sorts of predictions about the state of the economy, what needs to be done, how long will the recession last, what will be the economic growth next year, what will inflation do? And they often prove to be wrong. In fact, few economists even tend to agree on many of these things. And it's very important to realize that because oftentimes, when you're deep in the mathematics of the economics, it might seem to be a science like physics, but it's not a science like physics. There's open, it is open to subjectivity, and a lot of that subjectivity is all around, is all around the assumptions that you choose to make.\"\n",

       "    \"text\": \"The goal of this video is to appreciate how ideas of natural rights and social contract and limited government and popular sovereignty are embedded in America's founding documents. But before we start looking at the documents themselves, let's just make sure we understand the context in which they were written. As we enter into the mid-1770s, you have the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, which begins in 1775. A little more than a year after the beginning of the war, you have the Second Continental Congress decide to formally declare independence on July 2nd, and the Declaration of Independence, which we will study a bit in this video, is formally approved on July 4th, 1776, which is when we now celebrate Independence Day, even though some could argue that it was July 2nd. Now, as soon as the colonies decide that they are independent from the Kingdom of Great Britain, they have to think about how do we govern ourselves. And so within roughly a week, a little more than a week, after the Declaration of Independence is approved, they start drafting the Articles of Confederation. Remember, the Revolutionary War is still going on. Eventually, what will be known as the Articles of Confederation go into effect in 1781. Now, this Articles of Confederation really treat the various colonies as you could almost view it as separate states that agree to work together for purposes of getting independence from Great Britain, for purposes of fighting the war, for purposes of diplomacy. Now, over the course of the next several years, it becomes clear, especially through things like Shay's Rebellion, which we will look at in other videos, that the Articles of Confederation don't provide a strong enough central government. And so in May 1787, you have what is called as the Constitutional Convention convening. It's presided over by George Washington, who led the Americans in the Revolutionary War, which they eventually will win, as you see, and obviously we're an independent country now. And the original intent of the Constitutional Convention was to revise the Articles of Confederation. But folks like Madison and Hamilton were really intent on just completely replacing it. And what they replaced it with was what is now the U.S. Constitution, which goes into effect in March of 1789. And shortly thereafter, you have the beginning of Washington's two terms. And to be clear, the idea of even having a powerful executive, the idea of even having a president, was not present in the Articles of Confederation. That comes with the Constitution. So with that context out of the way, let's look at especially the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. So here's the beginning of the Declaration of Independence, written by Jefferson and edited by Benjamin Franklin and John Adams. And I encourage you to pause this video and first try to read it on your own and see if you can identify these ideas of natural rights, limited government, popular sovereignty, republicanism, and social contract. Okay, let's read this together now. When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with another. Remember, this is a Declaration of Independence. They are dissolving the political bonds with the kingdom of Great Britain. And to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them. So that's starting to refer a little bit to natural rights. A decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. So they're saying, hey, we're writing this document because we're trying to show the rest of mankind why the reasons for which we are deciding to declare our independence from Great Britain. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. Let me underline this. That all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. So this is a direct reference to natural rights. In fact, the phrase life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, most historians believe is in direct reference to John Locke's phrase life, liberty, and property when he talks about natural rights. So this is direct reference to the Enlightenment ideas or even the pre-Enlightenment ideas of natural rights. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. All right, this is worth underlining as well because they're talking about governments being instituted among men to secure these rights. This is all about social contract. So that's social contract. That we form a government in order to secure rights. We might give it some rights, but in exchange, the government has to protect our rights. And they derive their powers from the consent of the governed. So let me write that. Let me underline that actually in a different color. Derive their powers from the consent of the governed. That is popular sovereignty. Popular, I'll just write it as pop-sov. Popular sovereignty right over here. That the people are the sovereigns. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute a new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness. So this is more about social contract. They're like, look, if a government breaks its social contract, we have a right to replace it. And the document also makes reference to organizing its powers in such form. So that's really talking about limited government. They're talking about, hey, this government just won't have the absolute right to do anything. So that right over there is limited government. Prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes. They're essentially saying, look, you shouldn't just overthrow your government on a whim. And accordingly, all experience have shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. So they're saying, look, if you're prudent, you wouldn't just overthrow your government on a whim. But they're kind of saying we're not so worried about that because history has shown us, experience has shown us that if anything, people are more likely to keep suffering even when they should be overthrowing their government. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security. So they're saying, hey, look, the Kingdom of Great Britain, they are abusing us. They are usurping power. Usurping is taking something from you that is yours. And so we need to throw off such a government for our own future security. And here it says provide new guards for their future security. So this provide new guards, once again, making reference to limited government.\"\n",

       "    \"text\": \"What we're going to do in this video is discuss some of the foundational ideas for the United States of America. And we could start at the most foundational of ideas, and that's the notion of natural rights. John Locke, one of the significant Enlightenment thinkers, describes rights like life, liberty, and you might expect me to say pursuit of happiness, which is what we see in the Declaration of Independence, but John Locke refers to life, liberty, and property. But even though his version is a little bit different than what ends up in the Declaration of Independence, most historians believe that Thomas Jefferson was heavily influenced by John Locke's idea of natural rights when Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence. And the idea here is that these are rights that people should be born with, that should never be taken away from them. And in the video on social contract, we talk about the idea of why someone would form a government. They would form a government, they would give some rights to a government in order to protect these basic rights, things like life, liberty, property, the pursuit of happiness. And so you might have some other rights that one would say in a state of nature people might have, the right to do physical harm on others, the right to imprison others, the right to tax others. But in a social contract, we decide, hey, instead of everyone trying to figure out things on their own, let's give these rights to a government. And in exchange, the government should protect, should protect all of these rights for the individuals. And once again, this is review from the social contract video. This is a notion of a social contract. Now the next question is, all right, so if we are willing to engage in this social contract with a government, what type of a government should it be? And throughout most of human history, governments have been things like monarchies, where you have a single individual, maybe a king or queen, an emperor, some type of a conqueror, who is the sovereign, who rules over the state. But you could have, you could, instead of having one, you could have a small group, which would be an oligarchy. Or you could go to the other extreme, where the people are sovereign. And the word for that, and this is a key idea for the United States, is popular, popular sovereignty. The people are sovereign. The government is accountable to the people. Sometimes this could be referred to as democracy. Now the founding fathers of the United States were a little bit suspicious of pure democracy, or direct popular sovereignty. They were afraid that if you start having factions and a majority faction were to come to power, if you have a straight democracy, then they might use that power to strip some of the natural rights of, say, their political enemies or people that they just don't agree with. And so you have this other idea of limited government. Limited government. And some of the key things that limit the government, you could just say generally the rule of law, things like the Constitution, including how the government is structured, the checks and balances in it, the Bill of Rights, clearly is a check on government. And you don't just have limited government when you have a democracy. You could have a limited government even in a monarchy. The United Kingdom is officially a constitutional monarchy where you have a monarch who's sovereign, has very limited powers, because of things like the rule of law. Now the last idea that we're going to talk about in this video is the notion of a republic, or the idea of republicanism. Because the founding fathers didn't actually like calling the United States a democracy. Instead, they favored calling it a republic. And the word republic can mean different things to different people today, depending on what context you use. To some folks today, it means any form of government that's not a monarchy. To other folks, it means, okay, you have a democracy, you have popular sovereignty, but you have limited government. You still have rights that protect minorities, rights that make sure that even if people are not in the majority, they are protected. To the founding fathers, they had a version of this notion of republic. They did view a republic as something that would prevent the passions of an unfettered, pure democracy. But they thought it came mainly by having a representative democracy. That if you had a smaller group of elected representatives, as opposed to everyone getting involved in every issue, that they could calm the passions of the crowds, so to speak. They also thought it was logistically more practical. Sure, ancient Athens could have something closer to a pure democracy, but that was just a small city-state. Well, here, even the 13 colonies were significantly more vast, and obviously, the United States would become even more vast than that. And to appreciate this notion of a republic, right over here is a quote from James Madison in The Federalist Papers number 10. And just for some context on what The Federalist Papers even were, as we mentioned, shortly after the Declaration of Independence, the founding fathers start drafting the Articles of Confederation. They go into effect in 1781. But this is really a loose confederation of states that each individually think of themselves as sovereign states. And it's really a pact that they'll engage in war together, diplomacy together, free trade. But you have Shay's Rebellion, and it's very clear, and we'll talk about this in other videos, that the Articles of Confederation are not powerful enough. And so you have a constitutional convention in mid-1787 in which James Madison is a central figure. Some people discuss him as the father of the U.S. Constitution. They draft what is today the Constitution, but then they have to sell it to the states in order for it to be ratified. Alexander Hamilton has the idea of, hey, why don't we publish a series of papers? And they eventually publish 85 papers, which will collectively be known as The Federalist Papers. And Hamilton writes most of them, but he also recruits James Madison and John Jay. And Federalist Papers Number 10, which is perhaps the most famous, is James Madison's discussion of how do you avoid factions taking over the government and doing things that are not in the interest of the people? And I encourage you to read all of Federalist Papers Number 10, but I have a very small quote here. And this is James Madison's notion of what a republic was, and he thought the United States should be a republic. The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic are, first, the delegation of government in the latter, so he's talking about a republic, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest. So he's really talking about representative democracy, but he thought this was a key component of being a republic. Secondly, the greater number of citizens and greater sphere of country over which the latter may be extended, that only through a representative government could you actually govern over 13 colonies or even beyond 13 colonies. And that's why today, obviously, you might have had something closer to a pure democracy in ancient Athens, which was a city-state, but today, almost any democracy is some form of representative democracy, which James Madison would consider to be a republic. But if you wanted to classify the United States today, a fair term might be it is a democratic republic. You definitely have popular sovereignty. The people are considered sovereign, but they don't rule directly. They rule through representatives, which, by Madison's definition, would make it a republic. So now that you're armed with some of these basic ideas, I encourage you to engage even more with some of the founding documents for the United States. And on top of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, I encourage you to read as many of the Federalist Papers as possible, because it's really an explanation of the ideas behind the U.S. Constitution. And you should start with Federalist Papers number 10. As you'll see, James Madison is quite insightful. He predicts how factions might form, how parties might form, and not always do things in the interest of its people. But I'll leave you to decide whether he was right, whether forming a republic helps this notion of factionalism and look at the world that we are in today and think about whether James Madison would be happy or maybe he would be a little bit uncertain about how things turned out.\"\n",

       "    \"text\": \"The entire field of economics is based on the idea of scarcity, and arguably, we wouldn't even need a field of economics if there wasn't the notion of scarcity in the world. So what does scarcity mean? Well, think about it. What does it mean in everyday life? It means that there's not enough of something to go around. If we're talking about scarce goods, scarce services, scarce resources, we're talking about things where if there was no cost associated with them, people would use far more of that than there actually is around. And in this video, we're gonna think about different types of goods and services, or just resources, and think about whether they are scarce or not. So a related idea to scarce resources is its opposite, which is the notion of a free resource. So this is something that you could argue is infinitely abundant, or at least in a certain context, is so abundant that it feels like people can have as much of it as they want. The more that one person has of it, it doesn't take away from someone else. And the reason why scarcity is essential to economics is because economics is the study of how do you allocate these scarce resources. If there's more demand for it than the amount of thing that there is, well, who gets it? How much of it do they get? And what do they have to give up in exchange to get those scarce resources? But for the sake of this video, let's just first make sure we understand and have a good idea of what resources are scarce and which ones aren't and why. So this is a picture of caviar, which is essentially fish eggs. And it's not easy to get. The fish eggs are deep in the water. Someone has to get to them, and then they have to package it in some way, and they have to get it to your plate. And so do you think that caviar is a scarce resource or a free resource? Well, if it was a free resource, that means that we're just swimming in caviar, that it's so abundant that I could just have as much caviar as I want, and there's still as much as you want, and that everyone gets as much caviar as they like. Well, that's clearly not the case. Caviar is a scarce resource. In fact, it is a quite scarce resource. And because of that, if you want it, you have to give up a good bit to get it. This is a picture of some people working in a factory. And the resource that jumps out here is that of labor. And labor's interesting because it's not as tangible as something like caviar, but it is a resource. And one could even argue that the caviar on your plate, some of its scarcity comes from the labor involved of getting it to your plate. But here, these are clearly, it looks like these are gentlemen who are putting together some type of fabric. And so would you consider labor, would you consider that a scarce resource or a free resource? Well, it would be a free resource if people were willing to just do as much work for other people, actually willing to do an infinite amount of work for other people, which isn't even humanly possible. And even if it was humanly possible, people aren't willing to do that. They want something in return. And so once again, it is a scarce resource. There's many resources that are pictured right here. You have this beautiful town next to this alpine lake. And so some clear scarce resources are here. Many people would love to have a view like you would get from this house or hotel right over here, but not everyone, and many people would love to live there because of the view, but not everyone can live there. So that is a scarce resource. The water here is an interesting one. I could imagine in earlier times, if before there was a town here, if there was just a primitive village living next to this fresh water, they would probably view it as a free resource. If someone was thirsty, they would just go up to the lake and they would just drink from the lake. They would not have to give up anything to drink from that. But now the town, it might be a little bit more of a scarce resource. They might wanna preserve it for various reasons. In order to get the water to your sink in your house, there might be some services or goods or labor involved. Someone has to set up the pipes. Maybe it has to be cleaned in some way. Well, then it might become a little bit more of a scarce resource. Air, for most of human history, has been considered a free resource. And even today, I'd argue that something like oxygen, at least on our planet, is considered a free resource. When I take a deep breath, it does not affect your ability to take a deep breath. It does not take oxygen away from you. Now, is there an infinite amount of oxygen in our atmosphere? No, but for our purposes, it feels like there's an infinite amount. Now, if the photosynthetic plants were to disappear and all of a sudden the oxygen started to get diminished, or if we were in a space station where there isn't a seemingly infinite amount of oxygen, well, then you could imagine a world where it could become a scarce resource. You could imagine a colony on the moon or on Mars or in the space station where it had some type of economic system to decide who gets how much oxygen. So I will leave you there. As already mentioned, scarcity is the central idea in all of economics. It's the reason why we even need a field called economics. And as you go forward in your study of both micro and macroeconomics, we'll be looking at ways to allocate these scarce resources. We'll try to study what people have to give up in order to have access to these resources. And we will have models that will help us understand what are the implications for these different methods of allocating resources.\"\n",

       "    \"text\": \"What we're going to do in this video is dig a little bit deeper into the notion of democracy. And the reason why this is going to be valuable is it's going to inform the decisions that the founding fathers had to make when they thought about whether to ratify the Constitution. It'll also inform our thoughts on government as it is today in the United States. What flavor of democracy does it take on, especially at different layers of government? So just as a review, and this is something that we have talked about in other videos, democracy comes from Greek, from rule by the people. Demo from demos, which is referring to people. And krasi coming from kratia, which is referring to rule. So rule by the people. Now broadly speaking, we can think of three general flavors of democracy. The first we can consider to be participatory, participatory democracy. The second we can call pluralist democracy. And I'll define these in a second. And then the third, let's call that elite democracy. Elite democracy. Now what do you think participatory democracy means based on the word participatory? Yes, as you might have guessed, it implies broad participation of the population. Broad participation. What are examples of a participatory democracy? Well, imagine a small town that has maybe a few hundred or a few thousand people. And if there's an issue of whether to build a stoplight at an intersection or change some of the zoning laws, you can imagine a large chunk of the town showing up to weigh in on that decision. Now what are some of the benefits of a participatory democracy and what are some of the negatives? Well, the benefits are, and I'll do those as pluses, a benefit is, well, it kind of seems closest to the original spirit of a democracy. It's coming out of ancient Greece, ancient Athens, the birthplace of democracy, where you did have residents go together and debate the major issues. Although even in ancient Athens, you have to take participation with a grain of salt because it wasn't everyone who was participating. It was, for the most part, wealthy men who had the time to actually sit and debate these issues. But if we wanna give a participatory democracy its credit, say in a small town, is that you really are representing the views of the people. Representing the people well. The people are directly involved. Now what are maybe some of the negatives? Well, it can get logistically difficult. We talked about a small town, but what if the town gets a little bit bigger? Or what if we're dealing with a state or we're dealing with a country where we're talking about tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions or tens of millions of people? How do you get all of those people to weigh in on an issue, even logistically? How do they get informed about it? And are they even prepared to weigh in on those issues? Sure, if you're in a town, you can think about whether an intersection should be there or whether they should put a stoplight there. But if we're talking about matters of national or international importance, influencing hundreds of millions of people, can you depend on people to be informed about the intricacies of the banking system or the military or foreign policy? And so this is really a question of does this scale? And there really aren't any good examples in history of direct democracy scaling in significant ways beyond fairly small groups of people. In the United States, the biggest scale where you might see this are in things like ballot measures at the city or the state level where people are directly voting on certain measures or certain laws. But even there, it's a limited scope for what the people will actually weigh in on. Now, the next category that we talk about is a pluralist democracy. Pluralism is referring to the idea of many different parties, same root as the word plural. You have many things. So you have many different parties and many different competing interests that are going to have a vigorous debate with each other on deciding what are the best ideas. And what are examples of pluralist democracies? If you think about the United States, there are many different interest groups. You could think about all of the different lobbyists, all of the different groups that represent different types of people trying to convince members of Congress either at the national level or even at the state level that their interest is right. Even within Congress, even though you have two major parties, you can have different factions that are really trying to argue it out. Now, what are the benefits of a pluralist democracy? Well, you can imagine that because there's this vigorous debate, maybe the good ideas surface. Good ideas surface. You don't have domination by just one party. No one group, one group or a small group of people, domination. But then on the other side of it, maybe there are some negatives. What might those be? Well, maybe all of this debate and argument is very inefficient. Maybe it takes a, maybe it's slow decision-making. Slow decisions. Or an extreme, no decisions. Some things like gridlock because people can't agree to things that in order for anything to get done, you have to make too many people happy and they all have their interests. Maybe the opposite of good ideas surface. Maybe good ideas die because it's very hard to make everyone happy. Now, the last category that we're gonna talk about is the idea of an elite democracy. And this is where you have more limited participation. So in some ways, it's almost the opposite of a participatory democracy. So this is limited, limited participation. And even though I gave ancient Athens as an example of a participatory democracy, it really was more of an elite democracy where the people had the time and the influence and the money. Those were the ones who were really weighing in on the issues of ancient Athens. And if you were to go to the Roman Republic, the Roman senators, these were, once again, elite men. So what would you think are benefits of an elite democracy? Well, one might be that these elites, so to speak, maybe they are more educated than the general public. And so that allows them to make more informed decisions, especially on things that are quite complex. It would be hard for everyone to weigh in on. If you're gonna change a new accounting standard or think about how do you regulate the telecommunications industry or some very sophisticated trade negotiation or foreign policy negotiation that education might help. And maybe it's also more decisive than either one of the pluralist or the participatory. The participatory, they might be able to appeal to maybe baser instincts, just people's passions, while the pluralists, since you have all of these groups competing, even if something makes sense, they might not be able to make that decision. But if you have a smaller, more limited group, limited participation, maybe they can make these decisions a little bit clearer. But what are the negatives here? Well, the clearest negative is, well, maybe this goes against the whole idea of a democracy. If it's all about the elites, maybe they do a good job at truly representing the interests of the people, but maybe they are good at representing the interests of the elite. So do they really represent the people? Is this a democracy where the people are sovereign, where the people rule? Or is this an oligarchy where only a few people rule and they rule in their own interests? And so after watching this video, look at the world around you. Think about in the United States or whatever country you are watching from, what elements of a participatory democracy do you see? What elements of a pluralist democracy? And what elements of an elite democracy do you see? And as we'll see in other videos, these dimensions of democracy were vigorously debated by the founding fathers when they thought about whether to ratify the Constitution. We'll see this debate when we look at the anti-federalist papers, especially we'll look closely at Brutus number one. We'll see this debate when we look at the Federalist papers, especially Federalist number 10 written by James Madison. And I'll let you decide when we look at that who was right and what flavors of democracy are most dominant in the United States at different levels.\"\n",
