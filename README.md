# SmartNotes

This repository contains the codebase and resources for an AI-powered system to convert lecture speech (live or recorded) into student-friendly notes. The project aims to enhance learning experiences by automating the process of note-taking during lectures and leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques.

## Features

- Convert lecture speech into summarized notes
- Real-time transcription of live lectures
- Integration of AI models for efficient note generation
- User-friendly web interface for interaction

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Flask
- Whisper (for speech-to-text)
- Facebook's Bart Model (fine_tuned for this project)
- Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ajaypokharel/ai-powered-notes.git`
2. Install dependencies:
   - Backend `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Frontend `npm install`
  
3. Run the Flask server in the backend/api directory: `flask run`
4. Run the React server in the frontend directory: `npm start`

# Usage

1. Upload a lecture video or provide a live transcription link.
2. Select the desired options for summarization and note generation.
3. Receive student-friendly notes generated by the AI system.
